I think this course is great for those who even have a slight interest in these fields, but I will say, that this course made me realize that I am not interested in humanities. Although the surgical aspects were interesting, I felt uninterested in many of the readings, especially the earlier ones. If you're not interested in humanities or history at all, I wouldn't recommend this course, but if you are, and are considering pre\u2013med or simply have an interest in medicine, I definitely would recommend this seminar. Most of the readings aren't bad, but some can be like 20+ pages. I don't recommend skipping out on the readings as without reading, you won't be able to participate in discussion and it feels so awkward while a few of the students who actually did the reading are speaking and engaging in discussion with the professor while you are silent and don't have anything to add. I do recommend skimming most of the readings, especially if they're long. As long as you have a general idea of the subjects, you'll be able to add to the discussion, so skimming is fine in my personal opinion. I know other students who went overboard and read everything and took notes, but I didn't do all of that and was still able to participate. I would say try to do the readings a day or two before class so you don't forget the topics on the day of class. You can also take notes during the readings, but I didn't. The papers are not bad (the first one is a 5\u2013paragraph essay and the second is a 3\u20135 page double\u2013spaced essay + presentation) and Dr. Milham provides useful feedback on your writing. I really enjoyed the field trips we went on to Countway Library and Harvard Medical School's anatomy lab.  Honestly, as long as you pay attention in this course and skim the readings, you'll be fine. This is essentially a very low\u2013commitment seminar with fun field trips and a great professor!",

Every week, you\u2019ll get to discuss various aspects of the universe, modern physics, and astrophysics over cookies and milk. Professor Strominger\u2019s experience and renown also means that he gets very cool guest speakers to come in (including a Nobel Prize winner this year) and that he\u2019ll share anecdotes of working with people like Stephen Hawking! Though the readings are long and sometimes dense, try to at least skim them before class and always be thinking of questions to ask. This seminar is not limited to those interested in pursuing physics\u2013 regardless of your intended concentration, don\u2019t rule it out! I highly recommend taking this seminar for an insight into what it\u2019s like to pursue theoretical physics or just a glimpse into the incredibly fascinating mysteries of our universe.",

Professor Sampson is clearly very knowledgable and passionate about the area of study and facilitates some very engaging and captivating discussions throughout the course. The readings and assignments (only 2: one final paper about your hometown and some memos throughout the semester) were light and interesting, especially compared to other seminar classes with loads of reading. Some really fun components to the course as well, like guest speakers (honestly one of my favourite parts of the course) and a visit to the Harvard Museum!

        "best_comment": "This course provides a unique opportunity to explore Professor Miron's consequential libertarian perspective on a wide range of major policies, encouraging students to engage with real\u2013world political issues. One of the key strengths is the flexibility of the course structure. You can sign up for any section that fits your schedule, and each section is led by different TFs or past students, which brings varied insights to the material. Additionally, the optional writing requirement is a great feature\u2014it only accounts for 5% of the grade and is graded leniently, making it an easy way to boost your grade. The grading is generous overall, with a curve, and the course workload is manageable (e.g., there is no homework). However, it\u2019s important to stay on top of the readings and class discussions. Another strength is the accessibility of lecture materials, with slides and videos posted on Canvas, allowing students to review the content at their own pace. As I anticipated, the grading structure was oversimplified: it consists of three (and optionally four) components\u2014Final (50%), Midterm (40%), and Attendance (10%), with an optional economics writing requirement (5%) that scales down the weight of the other components. This means that your grade is heavily dependent on the midterm and final exams. Given that the material on the midterm is independent of the final, it\u2019s crucial to perform well on both. The exams are mostly focused on memorizing readings and lecture material, so taking detailed notes is essential. The slides, while useful, are minimalistic (black text on a white background); be sure to supplement them with your own notes. Additionally, the slides from section meetings aren\u2019t always posted, so it\u2019s important to stay engaged and attentive during those discussions.As for Professor Miron\u2019s teaching, while his libertarian perspective is thought\u2013provoking and much of it makes sense, some of his arguments can come across as radical. At times, he would claim that those who disagreed with his views lacked strong evidence, referencing studies that weren\u2019t always persuasive. With that being said, this aspect of the course is always an opportunity for intellectual engagement, as you can agree with or challenge his points and ask questions to explore your viewpoints. The freedom to share your opinions and dig deeper into the material is one of the most valuable aspects of the class, allowing you to form your own perspective on the libertarian arguments presented.",

Professor Bavitz, an experienced copyright attorney, brought a professional perspective to the class, making the material engaging and relatable. His personal warmth, including his treats he would bring, created a welcoming atmosphere. He is a really intelligent person and has a stupendous vocabulary.The course offered fascinating discussions on topics like the history of the internet and its future, particularly around real\u2013world issues like online regulation. However, there is a seemingly strong pre\u2013law focus that wasn\u2019t immediately clear when I signed up and might not appeal to students looking for a broader exploration of online conduct beyond legal frameworks. Additionally, the small class size (10\u201315 students) sometimes led to an imbalance in knowledge levels, which could make discussions harder for less experienced students. With that said, if you do the readings you will be fine for the vast majority of the material discussed.The grading system was sat.\/unsat., with blog posts on current events and a final paper. This low\u2013pressure structure encouraged participation and was really stress\u2013free, but I would have liked there to be an option for it to be graded. Also, the focus on copyright, patents, and trademarks, while important, sometimes overshadowed other aspects of internet policy, making the course feel a bit one\u2013sided.All critiques I made are very minor though, I had a really positive experience. Overall, I gained a much deeper understanding of the internet's legal landscape and its implications for the future. This is an awesome, one\u2013of\u2013a\u2013kind class and a great seminar!",

You can really tell she cares about her students, and it shows in everything she does (she brought us pizza and cookies on the last day of class, and she\u2019d always bring cookies for every presentation).As for the course itself, I found it incredibly relevant to my life, especially since I\u2019m a senior about to enter the \u201creal world\u201d and adulthood. The workload is definitely manageable, and the classes are interactive and engaging. I highly recommend it!Professor Lewin\u2013Bizan also teaches another course on the earlier stages of development, which I also highly recommend. I wish she taught a third course so I could take that too! Overall, it\u2019s an awesome class that you won\u2019t regret.\u2014 JM",

I signed up for this course thinking that only gender issues and Korean media culture would be discussed, and THIS IS NOT SO, AND THIS IS AMAZING! From history to philosophy, from Korean culture to Western values, we touched on important social topics and broadened our horizons. I discovered new philosophers and figures that really broadened my horizon of knowledge. The readings were always very interesting and thought\u2013provoking. I applied a lot of knowledge from this course in my other classes!When it comes to the format of the course, I can't think of a more comfortable place. Everyone could voice their opinion without judgment, and since the number of people was small, it was possible to really give many important issues proper attention during the discussion. Being the only freshman, I learnt how to do college assignments properly and even improved my writing skills! Professor Choi was always very supportive and understanding! And every class she brought us snacks and gave us feedback after class, which I really appreciated.I was really worried about the final project, but Professor Choi helped me choose a topic, and I even ended up enjoying the process of doing it. Definitely the fact that the project can be made very creative helped a lot of people to be more creative with the assignment.In general, everyone should definitely take this course, because it is truly a treasure trove of knowledge!",

I think the take\u2013home exams are an amazing way to learn SO much and develop reading\/writing skills for academic STEM papers. I did spend many hours working on them, but I actually really enjoyed the process of shifting through articles on Google Scholar and found the lecture material prepared me well\u2013enough to understand what the majority of the literature was talking about. Professor Girguis is AMAZING! He is so passionate and excited about his profession and very well connected. There are field trips and ROV demonstrations which is so cool. Would also highly recommend to non\u2013STEM majors looking to take a STEM course, you will learn a lot but you don't need really any STEM background to take it. In general, I was actually excited to attend lectures and this is for sure one of my favorite courses taken at Harvard!",

The workload is very much manageable\u2013\u2013it is maybe just one or two weeks that you have to put in a little more work to create and give a presentation. Prof Randall's research is also SO interesting, and the whole class became more fun and conversational throughout the semester because the entire class consistently showed our interest and the fact that we were putting in the work. You'll get so much more out of this class if you do that\u2013for example we got to have a conversation with Kip Thorne and also took a field trip to the cosmograph gallery in the MIT Museum!!",
