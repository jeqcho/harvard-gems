The study of race in the social sciences and humanities is an established, dynamic, multidisciplinary, and international field. To understand race and racism with a global perspective, it is necessary to have a transdisciplinary, cross-cultural view to read critically the phenomena that intersect with this variable. Course readings are drawn from the fields of African and African American Studies, sociology, history, cultural studies, political science, anthropology, philosophy, journalism, and public health. The vast literature produced by scholars in diverse fields provides evidence of how race is based on narratives created to enslave, subordinate, exploit, and exclude millions of human beings across the globe.

By centering works by Black, Indigenous, gender minorities, and writers of color, the course examines how storytelling is used to establish and redistribute power.

As a discipline, anthropology is rooted in conveying and theorizing the particularities of lived social realities—which are often messy, complex, and unruly. On the other hand, social theory tends to provide a more abstract, though still empirically grounded, analytical framework, concepts, and theories about the nature of social life, the body, power, the economy, etc. While this class will introduce students to bodies of theory that have been particularly influential in anthropology, this course does not offer a general survey of social theory. The course seeks primarily to train students to learn how to read and write about theory in light of anthropological concerns, writing, and ethnography that you will come across in your concentration.",,Faculty of Arts & Sciences,,,Anthropology,Tutorial,,FAS Letter Graded,,,,Social Sciences

Unfortunately, as it is being currently run under Weiwei, it will be a massive, massive disappointment unless something changes. A few years ago, the projects in this class would be exciting and from a number of different partners, including companies like Microsoft. This semester, unfortunately, almost every single project was healthcare related, because that is Weiwei's work.  It was quite clear that many of these partners had no interest in the class, and simply did not care about the projects. Many project teams that I spoke to did not receive data and necessary information from the partners until almost the end of the semester; this was also true for my team's project. There was a general sense of complete disengagement from the partners. The class was also poorly organized – there was hardly any context about assignments, and TFs / project mentors themselves did not know anything about the assignments and deadlines. We were supposed to have presentations and exciting guest lectures from industry partners, but not even a single one ever happened. Weiwei is also just so unresponsive – she simply didn't show up to our group's meetings  twice (and didn't even tell us that she wouldn't be coming). There was simply no communication about most things – we were not even told about the exact timings and details of the poster session until the day of the session. Ironically enough, Weiwei and the TFs did not even show up to our poster session – we stood there for 3 hours presenting to random people passing by. In our weekly check–ins with her, it was clear that Weiwei had no idea what our project was about and where it was headed, which meant that we never got any concrete advice or sense of direction from her. I know, of course, that the capstone is meant to be a class where you own a lot of the decisions regarding the project and are expected to do things independently. But the problem was that we had a completely unresponsive partner and a completely unresponsive instructor in Weiwei, who simply didn't do anything. Not to mention that we didn't even have data to work with for most of the semester. Overall, I think that this class under Weiwei is a complete mess. The CSE department really needs to figure this stuff out and make sure that this doesn't happen in the future. MIT has a similar capstone project, and I've heard from their students that that class is one of the highlights of their MIT experience. It is a shame that the Harvard version is anything but that. To be fair to Weiwei, she is extremely smart and a wonderful lecturer. And I'm sure that she is also really busy with other things. But that doesn't mean that the capstone project (which is described as a 'mini thesis' for our program) can be relegated to being an afterthought by the instructor.

If you're an AM concentrator and you're looking for a class where you can learn without being overworked and stressed out with incredibly hard PSETs and exams, this class is for you. Each week there's a PSET/lab, which is can be time–consuming but the problems themselves aren't terribly hard IF you have experience with python. This class says no coding experience is required, but I think they aren't revealing how dependent the work in the class is with coding. I was appreciative of my experience with Python (cs32). Not that you'll fail without it, but you'd likely need to go to office hours, the optional Friday sections, and consult online sources, so this class might not be as stress–free then. But the class meets 2x a week, and attendance is only mandatory everytime for the presentation and lab days, and some random time when he takes attendance during lecture days. However, after the first month of class, you truly don't know when attendance will be taken (even during ""mandatory"" days). I skipped a lecture class one day to study for an exam, and he happened to take attendance that day, so my grade when down. This was late March, and it was the last time he took attendance. So in total he took attendance 10x for the semester, and even though I didn't miss a class after that, my attendance grade was still a 90. Not to say he was wrong for that, but just to say, be careful because attendance it isn't very routine.As far as the material, this class was a cool intro to AM, but I wish the classes were more rooted in the code since the PSETs and Lab were so reliant on it. The small taste of the conceptual parts of different AM topics were hard to follow at times. But that's no reason not to take this class! You totally should!

Additionally, this course is hard but the teaching staff is awesome and makes it super rewarding. Margo and the teaching staff are INCREDIBLE, which is extremely rare to come by and ultimately why I would recommend this course to AM majors. Margo LISTENS to her students (she doesn't have this attitude like ""I taught it you should know it immediately""). She always stops after covering concepts to get a vibe check on how the class feels about a certain topic and if she needs to go more in depth. She also genuinely cares a lot about her students and wants them to succeed. Midway through the course I was struggling quite a bit but I met with Margo and she calmed me down a ton. As in any course, some lectures are more dry than others and sometimes it's hard to get yourself to class but seeing Margo made me excited and motivated to go everyday. The teaching staff will differ every year but this year they were AWESOME. I used the Ed stem a lot, asking a bunch of questions about the homework, midterms, etc., and they were always answered in a timely manner by a TF or Margo.Overall, while this course was a grind I would certainly recommend it for anyone who is interested in math, willing to commit some time, and seeks a rewarding experience taught by awesome staff.",0.9981,"Simply put, this course is not structured in a way that values students' time.

The problem sets after the horrible slog are just 15% of your grade which is enough that you have to do them but not enough that it really matters that you do well on them. Please get rid of the completion problems, quite frankly they're a waste of time for everyone and the flood of them makes the problem sets take 15–20 hours to do and write up. Also student choice being a second problem set every other week simply feels like more busywork in a class that's already long hours with little substance. 9am three days a week seems to suit no one except for Margo, and this combined with the occasional unsolvable integral on the midterm gives us the impression as students that the teaching staff don't think about us much at all.",-0.893,,0.0,Ordinary and Partial Differential Equations,APMTH  105,Margo Levine,2026 Spring,Full Term,,,,,,17054,No Consent,,,False,True,False,True,False,True,False,"Ordinary differential equations: power series solutions; special functions; eigenfunction expansions.

However, this comes with the benefit that AP 50a/b does NOT contain exams, and only grades you on the TEAM component of assignments. As a result, you have a chance to correct all of your work before submitting it to be evaluated. Additionally, if there are still mistakes, you have the chance to do markups to correct it, ensuring that you perform well in the class.Overall, the reality is that AP50a/b will GUARANTEE you an A if you submit your work on time. The structure is outlined very early in the course, and the requirements are extremely straightforward. However, you must stay on track for all assignment and compete EVERYTHING on time. If you fall behind and either miss ONE assignment or have ONE dissatisfactory grade (and fail to make it up in a reasonable amount of time), it will automatically bump you down a full letter grade. However, as long as you complete all assignments on time and follow the course structure perfectly, there is no way you can go wrong.Notably, the learning atmosphere within AP50b remains one of the course’s biggest weaknesses, especially as it relates to specific members of the teaching team. While a majority of the teaching staff are supportive and work hard to create an encouraging atmosphere, there are very evident exceptions to this. Instead, the actions of some members of the teaching team continue to intimidate and discourage students, leading to the creation of an extremely toxic environment that fails to promote learning. One of the course heads, Robert Haussman, is the most unsupportive individual in the entire class. Although he seems to have a calm and encouraging personality when you first meet him, this is merely a facade. When students ask questions on Slack or in–person, he often responds in the most passive aggressive tone. For example, when a student asked about the progress of grade snapshots (a grade preview that the teaching staff typically provide at multiple time points throughout the semester to keep students on track), he chose to respond that he did not have sufficient time to fulfill this and told the student to go calculate it themselves, as the sheet to do so has “been there all year” long. This highlights his complete disregard of the needs of students and decision to blame students for a shortcoming of his own. Then, during check–ins, his discouraging personality is even more evident, with Robert often staying with groups for 30+ minutes on something that should realistically only take 10–15 minutes maximum. Beyond the questions asked within the assignment, he chooses to ask students follow–up after follow–up. While this would normally be acceptable (especially if used to try and further student understanding), he often becomes extremely disapproving and notably disgruntled when students have the smallest ounce of confusion. Having an instructor like this not only FAILS to create a helpful environment that facilitates student engagement and learning, but also TURNS STUDENTS AWAY from asking for help when they need it. Looking forward, this is an area that needs significant improvement, or AP50 will continue failing to meet the needs of its students. Unfortunately, this issue also persists with some of the course TFs. One TF in particular, Ri Dresser, is very similar to Robert and also leads to the creation of an unsupportive and toxic atmosphere in class. As one of the TFs that regularly does check–ins, they are known throughout the class as being one of the harshest graders, often giving VERY low scores to students for making simple mistakes. For context, check–ins are graded between 0–3, with 0 indicating no effort (or not completing the assignment), 1 indicating minimal effort, 2 indicating satisfactory work and effort (even if some of the work is wrong), and 3 indicating work that extends beyond the expectations of the class. With this in mind, 2 is the “normal” score that students should expect to receive as long as they present their work in a reasonable manner. However, Ri has a tendency to give VERY low scores, ranging from 1.3 to 0.8 to even 0.5, despite there being no valid reason for doing so. In fact, there are days where Ri was shown to give consecutive “failing” scores ranging between 0.5–0.8 to SEVERAL groups back to back, being the ONLY TF to do so. Beyond just the grading, Ri is also very unapproachable due to their attitude. In class, Ri oftentimes grips their head in agony and sighs loudly when students indicate confusion. In effect, this makes students extremely uncomfortable and creates an environment that appears to punish making mistakes (or being unsure about something), as opposed to encouraging learning and individual growth. Similar to the note above about Robert, the fact that members of the teaching staff act in this manner completely TURNS AWAY students from being passionate and wanting to learn physics. Instead, all it causes is students purposely trying to avoid these members of the teaching staff, knowing that asking them for help will only lead to further judgement and frustration. Despite my aforementioned complaints about AP50b, credit is due where credit is deserved – the saving grace for this course and silver lining amidst tons of issues is Kelly Miller, one of the new course heads. This semester, Kelly was introduced as one of the new instructors and began taking over the AP50 series. She will also be the primary course head going forward for both AP50a/b. As an instructor, Kelly is one of the most SUPPORTIVE individuals I have ever met, oftentimes trying to uplift students and encourage them to continue achieving higher. When students have questions, she acknowledges their needs and works to improve their understanding with compassion. As students bring up points of frustration with the class, she remains extremely receptive (and RESPONSIVE) to feedback, piloting new initiatives to try and fix the weak points of the course. Lastly, Kelly is just extremely positive – always seeming genuinely PASSIONATE about the course and as if she wants to see her students thrive. Knowing that Kelly will be permanently taking over the course gives me hope that AP50 will change going forward, with the intent of better supporting the needs of students. As a whole, Kelly should be seen as a role model to AP50 teaching staff on what a genuinely outstanding instructor looks like!Similarly positive things can also be said about the following TFs, who have gone above and beyond to make the class an enjoyable and learning class environment: Tayna Camargo, Alex Buzali, Soy Choy, and Anna Luong. Thank you to each of these amazing individuals for making AP50b more tolerable, and a better learning environment (despite the aforementioned flaws).With this in mind, I think AP50a/b is a great option if you are looking to ensure a good grade in physics and can accept the faults of the course. However, go in with a realistic expectation on the time needed to complete assignments, and an understanding on some of the weak points of the course overall. To any student choosing between PS 2/3 and AP 50a/b, good luck – I wish you the best of luck. Physics is a lot regardless of which course you choose, but work hard and you will get through it.",0.9986,"Be very careful taking this class. if you are a person who is not good with deadlines or a person who THINKS they are good at deadlines, think very critically about enrolling. I thought I was good at deadlines but realized that was for normal classes with normal types of deadlines and workflow. This class is insane and something is due EVERY SINGLE DAY. If you miss one thing you are at risk of your grade dropping an entire letter grade. The teaching staff does not teach nor provide any sort of teaching, guidance, or advice going into the various modules. They are also overly strict about meeting specifications in order to receive a particular grade.  It is really unfortunate that most students leave this course having learned nothing, being unclear about what they did or why, because there is no guidance from staff.

However, this comes with the benefit that AP 50a/b does NOT contain exams, and only grades you on the TEAM component of assignments. As a result, you have a chance to correct all of your work before submitting it to be evaluated. Additionally, if there are still mistakes, you have the chance to do markups to correct it, ensuring that you perform well in the class.Overall, the reality is that AP50a/b will GUARANTEE you an A if you submit your work on time. The structure is outlined very early in the course, and the requirements are extremely straightforward. However, you must stay on track for all assignment and compete EVERYTHING on time. If you fall behind and either miss ONE assignment or have ONE dissatisfactory grade (and fail to make it up in a reasonable amount of time), it will automatically bump you down a full letter grade. However, as long as you complete all assignments on time and follow the course structure perfectly, there is no way you can go wrong.Notably, the learning atmosphere within AP50b remains one of the course’s biggest weaknesses, especially as it relates to specific members of the teaching team. While a majority of the teaching staff are supportive and work hard to create an encouraging atmosphere, there are very evident exceptions to this. Instead, the actions of some members of the teaching team continue to intimidate and discourage students, leading to the creation of an extremely toxic environment that fails to promote learning. One of the course heads, Robert Haussman, is the most unsupportive individual in the entire class. Although he seems to have a calm and encouraging personality when you first meet him, this is merely a facade. When students ask questions on Slack or in–person, he often responds in the most passive aggressive tone. For example, when a student asked about the progress of grade snapshots (a grade preview that the teaching staff typically provide at multiple time points throughout the semester to keep students on track), he chose to respond that he did not have sufficient time to fulfill this and told the student to go calculate it themselves, as the sheet to do so has “been there all year” long. This highlights his complete disregard of the needs of students and decision to blame students for a shortcoming of his own. Then, during check–ins, his discouraging personality is even more evident, with Robert often staying with groups for 30+ minutes on something that should realistically only take 10–15 minutes maximum. Beyond the questions asked within the assignment, he chooses to ask students follow–up after follow–up. While this would normally be acceptable (especially if used to try and further student understanding), he often becomes extremely disapproving and notably disgruntled when students have the smallest ounce of confusion. Having an instructor like this not only FAILS to create a helpful environment that facilitates student engagement and learning, but also TURNS STUDENTS AWAY from asking for help when they need it. Looking forward, this is an area that needs significant improvement, or AP50 will continue failing to meet the needs of its students. Unfortunately, this issue also persists with some of the course TFs. One TF in particular, Ri Dresser, is very similar to Robert and also leads to the creation of an unsupportive and toxic atmosphere in class. As one of the TFs that regularly does check–ins, they are known throughout the class as being one of the harshest graders, often giving VERY low scores to students for making simple mistakes. For context, check–ins are graded between 0–3, with 0 indicating no effort (or not completing the assignment), 1 indicating minimal effort, 2 indicating satisfactory work and effort (even if some of the work is wrong), and 3 indicating work that extends beyond the expectations of the class. With this in mind, 2 is the “normal” score that students should expect to receive as long as they present their work in a reasonable manner. However, Ri has a tendency to give VERY low scores, ranging from 1.3 to 0.8 to even 0.5, despite there being no valid reason for doing so. In fact, there are days where Ri was shown to give consecutive “failing” scores ranging between 0.5–0.8 to SEVERAL groups back to back, being the ONLY TF to do so. Beyond just the grading, Ri is also very unapproachable due to their attitude. In class, Ri oftentimes grips their head in agony and sighs loudly when students indicate confusion. In effect, this makes students extremely uncomfortable and creates an environment that appears to punish making mistakes (or being unsure about something), as opposed to encouraging learning and individual growth. Similar to the note above about Robert, the fact that members of the teaching staff act in this manner completely TURNS AWAY students from being passionate and wanting to learn physics. Instead, all it causes is students purposely trying to avoid these members of the teaching staff, knowing that asking them for help will only lead to further judgement and frustration. Despite my aforementioned complaints about AP50b, credit is due where credit is deserved – the saving grace for this course and silver lining amidst tons of issues is Kelly Miller, one of the new course heads. This semester, Kelly was introduced as one of the new instructors and began taking over the AP50 series. She will also be the primary course head going forward for both AP50a/b. As an instructor, Kelly is one of the most SUPPORTIVE individuals I have ever met, oftentimes trying to uplift students and encourage them to continue achieving higher. When students have questions, she acknowledges their needs and works to improve their understanding with compassion. As students bring up points of frustration with the class, she remains extremely receptive (and RESPONSIVE) to feedback, piloting new initiatives to try and fix the weak points of the course. Lastly, Kelly is just extremely positive – always seeming genuinely PASSIONATE about the course and as if she wants to see her students thrive. Knowing that Kelly will be permanently taking over the course gives me hope that AP50 will change going forward, with the intent of better supporting the needs of students. As a whole, Kelly should be seen as a role model to AP50 teaching staff on what a genuinely outstanding instructor looks like!Similarly positive things can also be said about the following TFs, who have gone above and beyond to make the class an enjoyable and learning class environment: Tayna Camargo, Alex Buzali, Soy Choy, and Anna Luong. Thank you to each of these amazing individuals for making AP50b more tolerable, and a better learning environment (despite the aforementioned flaws).With this in mind, I think AP50a/b is a great option if you are looking to ensure a good grade in physics and can accept the faults of the course. However, go in with a realistic expectation on the time needed to complete assignments, and an understanding on some of the weak points of the course overall. To any student choosing between PS 2/3 and AP 50a/b, good luck – I wish you the best of luck.

If you miss one thing you are at risk of your grade dropping an entire letter grade. The teaching staff does not teach nor provide any sort of teaching, guidance, or advice going into the various modules. They are also overly strict about meeting specifications in order to receive a particular grade.  It is really unfortunate that most students leave this course having learned nothing, being unclear about what they did or why, because there is no guidance from staff.

As a fundamentals/beginners class, you don't need any prior art experience or even need to know how to draw. This class is all about learning from scratch in all sorts of different mediums. Some of them are:– 2D animation (drawn)– sand– clay– puppets– paper on layered glass (very cool)– stop motionJust so so cool. Every week there are exercises (not assignments, and as far as I could tell, not graded) where you learn a new medium. So one class will be dedicated to learned how to use Adobe After Effects, and the exercise that week will be to create a short (maybe 30 second?) long video with some of the stuff you learned. You're not graded on how good the thing you made is, just the fact that you learned how to use anything at all. It's literally the perfect environment for learning because you're encouraged to just mess around.The second–ish half (or maybe last third? time has all muddled up for me now) of the semester is dedicated to the final project. So the first half is working on a specific new tool each week and the second one is mostly self–work. After each week you will have ended up learning a bunch of new techniques and you'll have so many new tools at your disposal, that you can start pitching and idea for a final project. Some people made films that were 2–3 minutes long, and others under a minute. Every single student, with or without prior art experience, made amazing works and I'm so glad to have been able to see them all (and see them being made!)There are weekly screenings every Friday from 12pm–2pm (unless the schedule changes, but it's roughly 2 hours) where we watch a bunch of short animations. Just so so cool. If you can't go, you can make it up by watching them on your own time and submitting your thoughts on each one, but I can't recommend enough to show up in person because 1. you won't have to write anything, and 2. the in–person discussions are just so great.Lastly, the 4–hour long class can seem daunting, but it really does fly by. We take breaks half–way through (I use mine to get lunch lol) and plus it's not 4 hours of intense work, you're mostly sitting around comfortably working on your animation or messing around with puppets or clay.I've learned so much from this class from specific skills to how animation works as a process in general. I feel so much more prepared to animate more in the future, and will be taking the intermediate class too next semester!Ruth is AMAZING, and so is Michael!! They are so kind, patient and knowledgeable and it was just an honor to have been able to learn so much from them. I had a hard time with my final project because I'm a perfectionist, completely overestimated how much I could get done in the time I had AND started way too late (horrible combo), but Ruth and Michael helped me so much throughout the process. They really guided me on how to make my animation better, what to cut, and just generally how to go about it. I seriously cannot recommend enough that you take this class.

Professor Johnson and the teaching staff are absolutely excellent. The format of the class is ""flipped"" and involves a lot of independent work in group settings through problems, usually after brief lectures by Professor Johnson to start you off and introduce a concept. Personally, since I learn best by doing, this was an extremely effective way to learn. It was so much fun to get to know and learn from and work with the other people in our group, and we formed a close bond over the semester. Also, working in groups to try to figure out ways to tackle these challenging problems is legitimately a really good way to learn. Homeworks were very reasonable on Professor Johnson's part and you always feel very supported throughout the class. I thought the labs were a little bit frustrating, mainly because it felt like we didn't have enough background to write the level of depth needed for the reports. Nonetheless, the night lab where you try to observe an eclipsing binary on the Clay Telescope is REALLY COOL. The midterm exam is a group midterm where you have to explain class concepts to a random person who knows nothing about astrophysics. This is an AMAZING exam format. It really forces you to go back through all the material and make sure you fundamentally understand astrophysical concepts, so you can't get away with just knowing how to use equations. This is not something that we do nearly enough of at Harvard, and I really appreciate Professor Johnson's approach to learning. Whether you are an astro concentrator (and have no choice) or just interested in astrophysics, I strongly recommend this class, and specifically taking it with Professor Johnson!",0.9901,"This class partially killed my love for astronomy. The class was solely based on these worksheets that my group always got behind on, because it was riddled with material never covered in class, where we'd have to jump to crazy conclusions to figure out. Our motivation in the class dwindled severely over time just because we had no support and no idea what we were doing, and other groups just breezed by us because they ""got it"". Even worse were the labs, complete disorganized messes and the lab reports were horrible. So many things on the lab reports were very complex or not even gone over properly or at all during the lab section, and the teaching staff was extra inaccessible when so many people needed help with the lab reports. I don't think I've ever been so disappointed in something I've submitted for a class than my second lab report.

Methodological extensions for studying the causal effects of time-varying, longitudinal interventions will be touched upon as well. Further topics to be addressed may include instrumental variables approaches, principal stratification, causal mediation analysis, treatment effect heterogeneity, the causal dose-response curve, and causal survival analysis.

It was also nice to be in the same space as other thesis writers, where we could share our struggles and feel less alone in the process. I will say that needing to email your PI the results of each workshop feels kind of silly, especially when it doesn't seem to merit any response from them – I feel like it would've been sufficient for me to email it to my direct mentor. It feels like the course's expectations of how invested your PI is is rather idealized in comparison to reality. In terms of the thesis–writing experience, I ended up hella grinding all my experiments in the two months before the deadline, and (other than the introduction I wrote in the fall/winter break) wrote most of it in like two weeks.  During the summer before, I should've realized how much harder it would be to get things done during the school year – if you can, get as much as possible done during the summer and don't bank on making too much progress during the fall. Also, if you're going to leave your writing to the last minute, at least pretend like your thesis is due a day before it's actually do – the extra 24 hours left gave me time to do so much editing, and to write a whole extra section in my results (using data with inconclusive results that I had previously decided I didn't have time to include).",0.9631,,0.0,,0.0,Laboratory Research for Honors Thesis,CPB   99B,"Dominic Mao, Monique Brewster",2026 Spring,Full Term,,,,,,12282,No Consent,,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"Laboratory research in topics related to the CPB concentration, culminating in an undergraduate thesis submitted to the CPB undergraduate office for review by members of the Board of Tutors in Biochemical Sciences and the greater Boston research community.

The sections are quite interesting in theory– each section, you learn about and use a new Bioinformatic tool, and in your final project, you use 3 of those tools you learned about. However, the sections do not have enough structure in my opinion, as most of the time was spent just playing around with the bioinformatic tool yourself– The grading on psets was incredibly harsh– multiple points are taken off for simple / non–understanding mistakes, such as not writing water or acid/base co–products. This detracted from finding where my understanding was lacking– The psets, tests, and projects took a while to be returned (but the feedback was good, so this is not the biggest deal)– No information was provided about the grading curve at any point in the semesterTL;DR: Chem 171 is a good class and I would recommend it to anyone interested in biochemistry.

The material is very, very abstract, so it may be a bit unintuitive at first, but there are a lot of tidbits here and there that make for very interesting material –– some really weird math is sometimes sprinkled in to formalize things, and it's always quite fun. I think this class plays a complementary role to CS121: if your CS education is a brick wall, 121 is the grout, and 152 is the finishing coat, filling in the few details that really make everything work together. As someone who has never cared at all about systems, for instance, the framework given in 152 has really inspired me to go think about the implementations of programming languages in compilers, etc. in ways I'd really brushed off before.The class itself is not a huge amount of work: to be sure, it's backloaded, so be careful about the amount of work at the end of the semester, but the exams were fair, the TFs very helpful (shoutout to my personal GOAT, Jonas), and Prof. Amin is incredibly knowledgeable about the material and friendly. Her knowledge of the material is a bit of a double–edged sword: she's clearly incredibly smart and a fantastic researcher, but this means she assumed we all are, too, so a lot of the examples given in class are a bit too difficult to pick up on the fly, and I think they could benefit from a tad more hands–on time with the material over pure powerpoint lecture (she live–codes in a really impressive way, though, I have to give her that).I thoroughly enjoyed this class, and would highly recommend it to folks looking to round out their theoretical CS education or looking for a good bridge between theory and systems, because you really see both come alive.",0.9967,"There are not many good spring classes, so this one is one of the only ones that is relatively chill.

Yet, unlike other disciplines with a much longer history in formal schooling, the interest in computer science education is not yet supported by commensurate attention to research and teacher practice. In this course, we will examine the state of K–12 computing education: questioning its value, examining its history, and imagining and contributing to its potential. The course will be organized as both a reading group and a lab, building a community of people who are committed to K–12 CS education. Each week you will read classic and current research, and write accompanying memos to document your evolving understandings of the field. Throughout the course, either individually or with partners, you will develop an independent project that explores the design of K–12 computer science learning experiences. Some examples of possible projects include: designing CS-standalone or cross-curricular learning activities and curriculum, building a programming language for novices, developing an annotated bibliography, critically analyzing policy documents such as curriculum frameworks and standards from around the world, or contributing to current K–12 CS education research initiatives.",The course enrollment procedure will be posted to the course website.

Like, really bad. I wish “CS2540 says I speaksfor CS2540” so that I could make CS2540 say all the problems about itself. I want to robustly declassify and transparently endorse the pain of this class to the rest of the world while maintaining nonmalleable information flow.Starting with the lectures. They are not informative. On a lattice, it feels like Steve’s lectures are secret untrusted and I am public trusted with how difficult it is to make the lecture information flow to my brain. But when you ask a question, it flips; you suddenly become secret untrusted and public trusted as you can’t get any meaningful questions to Steve.It feels like Steve assumes too much during lectures. The prerequisites that he states (Good CS student and taken Formal Reasoning before) is nowhere enough as Steve will sometimes just skip over details and assume you know them when he has never taught them before. This creates problems; eventually he will just lose you unless you have studied this topic before, which is unfair to the students who took the listed prerequisites in good faith. Even with some knowledge of PL, a lot of his lectures are indecipherable. Steve says HisLectures speaksfor Steve, but the problem is that HisLectures says Indecipherable speaksfor HisLectures.Onto the homework. Why do they exist? What is the line between a “check” and a “check–plus” grade on the homework? Nobody knows. The line is so nonexistent that it will make you question whether you know the line using epistemic logic. What world are you in? Are you in a world where the line is clear? The homeworks say no. Are you in a world where you know that the homeworks are meaningful? The homeworks say no. In fact, using epistemic logic, you will eventually come to the conclusion that K_{You}(CS 2540 is a bad class). Of course, the only way you will know this is if you experience what set of worlds you may be in by taking the class, but I hope that this observation is enough for you.In fact, the class can be written in Tamarin like this. [CS2540()]––[]–>[Out(BadClass)]. Which, speaking of, is the worst homework I have experienced. No instructions, just pain. No practice in class, just pain. Steve gives you zero preconditions, and somehow expects your postcondition to contain happiness of working with Tamarin. Give us those preconditions. But given that the prerequisite list is terrible, is it a surprise that the preconditions are lacking?The project. Nothing but pain. Lack of instructions. Lack of rubrics. Lack of basis on grading. It’s so arbitrary that you can’t ever know if Steve is grading fairly or not. In fact, it seems likely that he isn’t. “Steve will always grade fairly” is a safety property, and if Execution Monitoring tried to enforce this property on this class, the class would have been canceled as soon as Steve began to grade. “Steve will eventually make good lectures for CS2540” is a liveness property, but it remains unsatisfied. No well–founded relation can be found to save this class.If you are still considering taking this course, think of a model of CS2540 that we will reason with. Reasoning through, we find that the class is vulnerable to a side channel. Through the pain it inflicts on its students, a side channel characterized by the stress of its students is created. Even when you have exploited this side channel, why would you try to experience a class of this exploitable model yourself? CS2540 and a class where you struggle and don’t learn much are contextually equivalent.To this end, remember that you have your secrets. With how public the pain of CS2540 is, if you want to enforce noninterference, you should not take this course and begin the transfer of information from a secret source to a public source. You might think you are going to take a fun formal reasoning course, but you have actually been exploited by a Man in the Middle Attack. You are communicating with a terrible class that is pretending to be a good formal reasoning course that has purposefully set up a Needham–Schroeder protocol to abuse this attack after throwing away Lowe from its protocol.Do not take this class. 1/5.",-0.9904,,0.0,Formal Methods for Computer Security,COMPSCI 2540,Stephen Chong,2026 Spring,Full Term,,,,,,13650,No Consent,,,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,"This course explores formal methods for computer security, including formal security models, relationships between security properties/policies and enforcement mechanisms, principled techniques and tools to specify, analyze, and construct secure computer systems.

Do not be afraid, choose a topic you care about, and embrace the ups and downs! Some advice I have for future thesis writers … 1. Choose a project or topic that means something to you (i.e. a physical location / earth system you’re interested in, a project with policy implications you care about, a methodology that would be challenging but rewarding for you to master). I found this went a long way in energizing me to work on my thesis. 2. Think about when you’ll have pockets of time to really focus on your thesis. For me, it was helpful to carve out designated days or couple day stretches to put other things aside and really focus on my thesis (senior year winter break was an especially important stretch for me). Also, choose a designated thesis cave location (thank you Peet’s Coffee and Ernst Mayr library)! 3.

The central objective of the New Climate Observatory is to address this problem by introducing, for the first time, the development of a new generation of innovative technology that takes explicit advantage of recent major advances in Harvard-based instruments and optical designs in combination with advanced solar powered stratospheric aeronautical design. The new solar powered stratospheric aircraft that together constitute the Climate Observatory engage multiple recent design innovations in photovoltaics, energy storage, as well as guidance and control. Together these enable a combination of long duration solar powered observing systems, each targeted at the highest priority risk factors that threaten global societal stability. The resulting observations will, for the first time, provide the irrefutable evidence needed for quantitative forecasts of the dominant risk factors stemming from the global use of fossil fuels.Important examples include the challenges of rapidly expanding wildfires in the western United States, the increasing rate of global sea level rise, the mechanisms controlling irreversible shifts in the large-scale (Brewer-Dobson) dynamical structure of the atmosphere, shifts in the drought patterns globally that trigger food shortages that in turn trigger refugee dislocation, as well as the mechanisms behind the loss of global fresh water supplies.While satellites have for years dominated the federal climate programs, for the purpose of developing tested and trusted quantitative forecasts of risk, satellites engender significant disadvantages. In sharp contrast to satellite systems, the new Harvard Climate Observatory provides, for the first time, orders of magnitude improvement in spatial and temporal resolution observations. ESE/EPS 166 will focus explicitly on this new generation of climate observations, forecasting, and resulting advances in public policy. An important part of the course is the display of Harvard designed and developed flight instruments in the laboratory in the context of multiple strategies for addressing unsolved scientific problems with new instrumentation.","EPS 166 integrates the challenges of climate scientific objectives with the strategy for instrument innovation, the lab is also integrated with the course structure.

This is the same as on cycle ec10, but you also have a bunch of other random assignments that they do not. For example, the deep dives and final project. Deep dives are every two or three weeks, and they are a big time commitment. That is what makes the course so hard to follow; you can't plan out how much time you need per week because it is always changing. The deep dives and final project also have very little relevance to the exams, so it is a frustrating mix of needing to still do the assignments but knowing they are not helping for the main chunk of the graded part of the class.

I have a much better understanding of how the macroeconomy functions, from the role of the Fed to the effects of tariffs to the stock market. The lectures were well–developed. The course did not include much fine detail and instead focused more on developing our intuition about macroeconomics; without prior experience in macroeconomics, I valued this approach. It allowed me to understand macroeconomics as a whole before deciding whether I want to explore the area in more depth. However, if you have taken macroeconomics in the past, this course might not be challenging enough. Additionally, some of Jason's lectures felt dry and dragged on a little. The content was interesting, but I think he could have presented it with greater tonal variation and expressivity.The guest lectures were incredible. When David and Jason discussed topics in class, they mentioned some of the most important research on that topic, and the guest lectures were usually part of that research! I felt lucky to be exposed to such giants in economics!However, I would have liked a more diverse range of guest speakers. Most of them were academics or politicians, and I would have liked to hear from more industry experts, such as bankers.The psets improved my grasp of the content. I especially liked how they reflected present–day events, like the effects of Covid and tariffs. Through them, I applied what I had learned in class and became more confident with the material.The problem–solving sessions are an incredible resource. The CAs helped me work through the psets and understand the concepts involved. They were all nice and supportive. The unit review program is also quite valuable. By studying for them, I consolidated my understanding of the material. The feedback I got after taking them showed me how well I had learned the content and where I should focus my studying. Because the problem–solving sessions and unit review program are so useful, I would highly suggest attending themThe tests do a good job of testing our understanding and problem–solving skills. The practice tests are a very useful resource to study for them; in fact, I think some of the questions were essentially identical to the tests.",0.9969,"FOR HUMANITIES STUDENTS:If you're on the fence about this class, take it!!!!!

Ec10b explains what economists do and do not understand about these issues by developing analytical approaches and examining data, including studying the global financial crisis and the economic crisis caused by COVID-19. The course also explains how policy makers can dampen economic fluctuations using monetary policy (i.e., government influence over interest rates and government regulation of banks), fiscal policy (e.g., government control of spending and taxation), and financial rescues in economic crises. We will also discuss how macroeconomic policies work in an international context, including the factors that affect exchange rates, trade deficits, international capital flows, and how these link economies around the world.

I absolutely loved this class. Our tutorial focused on managerial decision making, and the readings that Omar selected tied into important business and technology problems and helped me to critically think about real–world business challenges. I found this to be much more applicable than many other courses I've taken here, and it's a course I feel confident will shape the way I think about business problems for many years to come. It also drastically improved my ability to read research papers, understand econometric methods, and write essays, largely because of the way that Omar broke down these topics, provided in–depth feedback, and always made expectations clear for assignments. He is incredibly knowledgeable about econometrics, business, and technology, and he knew the papers very well and helped our class think about them on a much deeper level. Not only that, but we had many engaging class activities that I really enjoyed and that helped me learn in a more hands–on way.  This course could have doubled as instruction about how the ideal class should be taught. I've never felt this sad for a course to come to an end; it was truly an amazing class and I feel very lucky to have been in it, especially with Omar as my instructor.As far as other advice, I'd recommend at least concurrently taking econometrics, as this will really help understand the methods of papers. I'm not sure if Omar will teach another tutorial, but if he does I'd highly recommend taking one with him. I'd also say to choose a topic you're interested in, as this will make it easier to get through the readings and stay engaged during the class discussions. Additionally, the PSETs provide a lot more support for Stata than R, so I'd recommend Stata if you're choosing between languages. Finally, don't underestimate the workload, as you will have to complete PSETs, do many readings, and write papers, including a very long final paper. All of this can lead to a pretty significant workload, although I don't think that any of the work ever felt like busy work which I appreciated.",0.9973,,0.0,,0.0,Tutorial - Sophomore Year,ECON  970,,2026 Spring,Full Term,,,,,,11970,Instructor,,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,A series of seminars taught in small sections focusing on applications of economic theory to real problems.,One term required of all Economics concentrators.

Initially, I found a lot of the course pre–requisites really scary because there's statistics, linear algebra, and multivariable calculus. However, a lot of the course material doesn't require extensive knowledge of these topics. As someone who was very curious how econometrics works from a statistical and theoretical perspective, I found this class very interesting. I had taken EC50 a year prior, so I was familiar with the R implementations for various causal inference observational studies and wanted to understand the math behind them. If you're more so interested in getting very comfortable with applying these techniques in R, then EC1123 would probably be better for you. This class goes in–depth into derivations and mathematical assumptions, which gets really interesting as you progress. Also, the material nicely builds on top of each other, and there are cool topics that the Professor will discuss without them being tested on the final, giving students an opportunity to just enjoy the material. If you are thinking about doing EC1126 vs STAT 111 and EC1123, I'd say that EC1126 does a nice job in providing all the relevant statistical insights that you need for econometrics with good pacing. The course textbook is really good, the slides are very insightful, and the sections have nice R code implementations. The homework is also very close to the lecture material, which contrasts other classes where you might need to go OH to OH to even understand what a problem is stating let alone how to approach it.

I think those reviews will be more representative than for this year due to the different professor, but I'll still give my views on the course this semester as most should still be applicable.This course is a very nonintimidating introduction to fundamental financial concepts (stocks, bonds, derivatives) and I think it would be beneficial to everyone, not just econ majors or those considering finance. It delves much deeper than EC 70 (personal finance) into these concepts and would be useful knowledge for everyone, as you will eventually need to decide what assets to invest in with retirement accounts and savings.The class is not terribly theoretical, much less so than the main 1010/1011ab sequences. It's mostly just applying formulas and some basic intuition and is honestly very straightforward, especially if you have a stats background (e.g. Stat 110). You really won't be too surprised by exam questions (though I think they're probably a bit harder under Gabaix than Liu). You're given plenty of practice materials, and since this is such a plug and chug class (applying formulas), the fact that you can use a cheat sheet on the exams means that you really don't have to memorize that much information and should be able to do well on the exams with not that much preparation.The homework assignments are very light and essentially graded for completion. You only have to complete 6 of the 9 to receive a full homework grade, so it's essentially a 6 pset class, which is roughly one every other week if you use all 3 of your drops. Office hours are helpful for psets, but ChatGPT can also help to explain concepts very well since the material isn't that advanced. Using ChatGPT to help on homework assignments actually taught me a lot and helped me gain a better understanding of the concepts since you can ask it to elaborate and relay your points of confusion, so I'd recommend trying that. This class shouldn't take any more than 5 hours a week if you use your resources, though this might pick up again right before the midterm and final. There are also weekly optional sections that can help you review concepts, though ChatGPT did a good enough job of helping reinforce topics to where I didn't need to go to section and I did well on the midterm and final (the curve is quite generous, by the way, though I don't know how it will be under Gabaix).Weiling was a great professor, though she probably won't return next year. I assume Gabaix is just as good, but I'd again recommend reading Spring 2024 reviews if you want the closest parallel. But I would say that any econ major should definitely take this class to fulfill their theory prereq requirement and learn quite useful and applicable information.",0.9977,"I would not really recommend taking this class without prior knowledge. Lecture is very theoretical whereas the problem sets and exams are highly mathematical/problem–solving based, and I don't think that mismatch helps students learn.

In the US, over 2 million students struggle with specific learning disabilities (SLD), which represents roughly 35% of all students who receive special education services under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Children with a learning disability are less likely to complete high school or enroll in postsecondary educational programs and have a heightened risk for developing mental health problems such as depression or anxiety. Currently, SLDs are primarily identified and addressed within the education system; however, these students also receive care and support outside of school and are members of various community settings. A streamlined approach that informs the coordination of general education, special education, clinical psychology, policymaking, advocacy, caregivers, and health professionals (e.g., pediatricians, speech-and language pathologists) is often absent and hinders the design of preventive approaches, identification strategies, and service implementation. It further leads to a siloed approach for care and policymaking, lack of community supports.The course will provide a broad overview of learning disabilities and differences, including dyslexia, dyscalculia, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, developmental language disorder, and autism spectrum disorder, as well as the relevant policies and educational documentation for these learners. It will then cover the professional stakeholders that should be involved in an evidence-based response to a learning difference, and identify their unique knowledge base, toolset, developmental timeline, and communication strategies, both in the educational/professional environment and the community. Finally, we will focus on barriers and challenges faced by children with learning differences in the academic, professional, and community settings. Throughout the course, students will be provided with both research/evidence-based content and case-based learning opportunities, practical examples, and guest speakers drawn from the community.

Students will engage in discussions on systems and paradigms, the essence of intelligence, computational approaches, mind and machine metaphors, cognitive biases in AI, and the role of AI in creativity and intuition.The course emphasizes collaborative learning, with students working in teams to learn from each other, as well as from lectures and selected literature. Each lecture will be paired with research papers and books, followed by a discussion session.The topics covered in the course are listed in the syllabus. Each will include an overview of the issue and its significance. Students will apply systems thinking and a multidisciplinary approach to analyze and critique each topic. By the end of the course, students will have developed a strong framework for multidisciplinary discussions, gained a deep understanding of AI’s power, limitations, and risks, and explored its technical building blocks through hands-on exercises. Additionally, students will experience the value of collaboration and the importance of diversity while working in diverse teams.",ES 26 is also offered as ES 294 (for graduate students).

Do note that there are quite a few assignments – more so than I had anticipated, but they're all easily done with a good group (would recommend taking the class with at least 2–3 other people you know you'd work well together) and some of them are optional / count for extra credit.

The problem sets were also doable and fair; they aligned well with what was taught in class, and they were a good amount of challenging without being too frustrating. I do wish that there was some more discussion about the relationships between different concepts and how to utilize them to inform them when designing (and not to just do calculations on a given design), so that we have more of an idea of how we would apply these in the future. The exams were also fair, and they were similar to the format of the homework questions, so it was not too stressful studying for the exams, although the two midterms were a time crunch.I liked the bridge competition at the end of the semester, but it would have been nice to get more guidance on how we can make sure that we're optimizing the strength–to–weight ratio and design tricks/lessons for it. I also wish the labs were more hands–on, usually, we just watched the experiment being done and then just recorded the data. Also, the lab reports were sometimes tedious to do, but there are only two of them for the semester, so it's not too big of a deal. Overall though, ES 120 will teach you a lot, and the content will teach you a lot.

This expansive domain integrates computer science, statistics, big data, cognitive science, psychology, and philosophy. As a transformative technology, AI has achieved remarkable success in understanding natural language and emulating human reasoning, making it invaluable in augmenting human cognition.Despite these advances, many questions remain about the nature of AI and its relationship with human thought. This course invites participants to explore these questions through an intellectual journey. Students will engage in discussions on systems and paradigms, the essence of intelligence, computational approaches, mind and machine metaphors, cognitive biases in AI, and the role of AI in creativity and intuition.The course emphasizes collaborative learning, with students working in teams to learn from each other, as well as from lectures and selected literature. Each lecture will be paired with research papers and books, followed by a discussion session.The topics covered in the course are listed in the syllabus. Each will include an overview of the issue and its significance. Students will apply systems thinking and a multidisciplinary approach to analyze and critique each topic. By the end of the course, students will have developed a strong framework for multidisciplinary discussions, gained a deep understanding of AI’s power, limitations, and risks, and explored its technical building blocks through hands-on exercises.

Screenwriting has a distinct and highly specific form, and choosing to write a screenplay, rather than a novel or short story, should be a deliberate and intentional decision. For many students, it felt like that choice wasn’t grounded in a true engagement with the medium, but rather in a desire to take a light or ""fun"" creative writing course. Without a strong interest in film, important conversations around cinematic form, structure, and visual storytelling tend to fall by the wayside. As a result, much of the feedback focused primarily on plot, which made the experience feel less like an exploration of screenwriting as an art form and more like a general storytelling workshop. This limited the course's potential to offer a truly transformational creative experience rooted in the unique language of screenwriting. If you're looking for a fun and creative writing course, this one absolutely fits that description. But if you're seriously interested in becoming a filmmaker or screenwriter, particularly for feature films, it may fall short of expectations.

The central objective of the New Climate Observatory is to address this problem by introducing, for the first time, the development of a new generation of innovative technology that takes explicit advantage of recent major advances in Harvard-based instruments and optical designs in combination with advanced solar powered stratospheric aeronautical design. The new solar powered stratospheric aircraft that together constitute the Climate Observatory engage multiple recent design innovations in photovoltaics, energy storage, as well as guidance and control. Together these enable a combination of long duration solar powered observing systems, each targeted at the highest priority risk factors that threaten global societal stability. The resulting observations will, for the first time, provide the irrefutable evidence needed for quantitative forecasts of the dominant risk factors stemming from the global use of fossil fuels. Important examples include the challenges of rapidly expanding wildfires in the western United States, the increasing rate of global sea level rise, the mechanisms controlling irreversible shifts in the large-scale (Brewer-Dobson) dynamical structure of the atmosphere, shifts in the drought patterns globally that trigger food shortages that in turn trigger refugee dislocation, as well as the mechanisms behind the loss of global fresh water supplies. While satellites have for years dominated the federal climate programs, for the purpose of developing tested and trusted quantitative forecasts of risk, satellites engender significant disadvantages. In sharp contrast to satellite systems, the new Harvard Climate Observatory provides, for the first time, orders of magnitude improvement in spatial and temporal resolution observations.

These included medical crimes, which, thus far, are the most thoroughly documented examples of ethical transgressions of health care professionals. They include forced sterilizations, the “euthanasia” systematic patient murder program, and forced brutal medical experiments on the living and the dead. However, under conditions of oppression by the same political system, some health care professionals chose to retain the healing powers of medicine.Anatomy in Nazi Germany is an example of ethical transgressions in the medical sciences that reveals the complex relationships between scientists and the Nazi regime. Changes of the traditional anatomical body procurement manifested in the use of many bodies of Nazi victims in teaching and scientific investigations. Research gradually moved from routine studies to murder, from the anatomy lab to the Nazi prison system and then to the concentration camps. Ultimately, anatomists were complicit with the government through their role in the complete destruction of the perceived “enemies” of the Nazi regime.This history of medicine can thus serve as a model for the recognition of patterns and common roots with other histories of discrimination, oppression, and atrocities. Also, there are continuities and legacies from this history that reach into the present and have relevance for today’s education and practice in the health professions.","To students interested in applying to FYSEMR 23H: Medicine in Nazi Germany and the Holocaust—Your application to this seminar should state your interest and previous exposure to this topic.

Controversial and contentious subjects are sought in these writings: the imbalance of power between physician and patient; how different religions frame the genesis and outcome of disease; the role of quackery, avarice, and ego in molding doctors’ behavior; whether character changes for better or worse when people face their mortality; what is normal and what is abnormal behavior based on culture, neuroscience, and individual versus group norms. The presentation of illness in journalism will be studied in selected readings from the New York Times’ and Boston Globe’s Science sections, as well as periodicals like the New Yorker, The New York Review of Books, Harper’s, and the Atlantic Monthly. The members of the seminar will analyze how the media accurately present the science of medicine or play to “pop culture.” The seminar will study not only mainstream medical journalists, but so called alternative medical writers such as Andrew Weil and celebrity health voices like Gwyneth Paltrow.

If you think this is going to be a writing class or that you'll learn a lot about writing, don't take it.It's a very silly unserious class that takes itself very seriously. During class exercises we at one point ended up drawing a family tree for an assignment, we ran around and played tag, we made our own games and we drew comics. Honestly not super related to writing, more creating in general. This is more of a theatre class, so if you're into that, I WOULD recommend it!The class ended up being 6 students, and I now feel kinda trauma–bonded to all of them. I say this lightly because the class WAS fun, but it was wacky at times.One warning that I hope is changed in the future is that the homework is a little intense. Well – maybe not really, but it feels like it compared to the class. During class we'd sit and talk and draw and laugh and maybe run around and share snacks, but then get assigned 200–pages of reading with a 1–hour podcast to listen to that might not even get brought up the next week. There are weekly writing assignments that do not get brought up during class, and I don't think I ever really received feedback for them. I DID receive awesome feedback for stuff I did DURING class, or assignments that will be specifically relevant to class, but it felt like I was writing into a void sometimes.So a lot to consider – this class was definitely a lot. But overall, as much as I may have complained, I am actually glad I took it. It was VERY fun. Even the many many readings were super interesting, and we got to meet one of the authors we were assigned to read, too! We had little field trips throughout, which were awesome (going to museums, exhibitions, etc).

First, we ask: What is morality? Many people believe that morality descends from above, as divine commands or as abstract, timeless principles akin to mathematical truths. Here we take an empirical approach to morality, viewing it as a natural phenomenon that rises up from below—born of the strategic interactions among lifeforms and societies struggling to exist. Next, we take a scientifically informed look at the foundational questions of moral and political philosophy. Many people believe that the “is” of scientific knowledge has nothing to do with the fundamental “oughts” of morality, that science and morality exist in separate realms (and belong in separate courses). Here we challenge this assumption, asking whether our scientific self-knowledge can, and should, change our views about what’s right and wrong and how a society should be organized. Finally, we consider the distinctive moral challenges posed by what may be the next stage in Earth’s evolutionary history: the rise of artificial intelligence. Many people believe that there is and always will be a fundamental division between human minds and machines. Here we challenge this assumption, going beyond the tropes of science fiction and drawing instead on the latest advances in cognitive neuroscience and neurally inspired artificial intelligence. Our conclusions will have implications for moral challenges of the near and more distant future: Can self-driving cars, military drones, and life-like robots be programmed to behave morally? Will artificial intelligence displace human labor? If so, how can our societies adapt? Could machines displace humans entirely? If so, how can we stay in control? If machines do take over, will they be our conquerors or our children? Across diverse topics, this course explores the implications of a single idea: that the wonder we see around us, and ahead of us, is the product of competition and cooperation at increasing levels of complexity.","Not open to students who have taken PSY 2250.

Does the nature of the material artifact inscribed with words shape or influence the way you understand their meaning? Do people read a scroll differently than they do a book with pages? Or a digital text on a screen? Why does the physical book persist in the digital age? To answer these questions, we will study the many different material forms in which texts in Western culture have been inscribed—from tablets to e-books—and the technologies that have enabled their creation. We will also explore every possible aspect of the object we know as a “book,” from the title page to the index, and from the layout of a page to the use of illustrations and decorations—and what each of these features of the book can tell us about its historical role, how readers have used the book, and what it has meant to them. Books we will look at will range from the Bible to Vesalius, from Homer to Harold and His Purple Crayon. Sections will visit the Weissman Preservation Center, Houghton Library, Fine Arts Special Collections, and the Harvard Art Museum, and all students will be required to study a manuscript close-up and participate in a printing workshop.

We are the only ones who expend tremendous amounts of time, energy, and resources trying (sometimes obsessively) to understand our futures before they happen. While the innate ability of individual people to predict has not changed much in the past few millennia, developments in mathematical and conceptual models have inordinately improved predictive systems. These systems have integrated comparisons to past results and quantified how “certain” we can be about various aspects of the future -- processes that were, in many cases, inconceivable at one point in the past. This course is a coordinated investigation of the history and future of prediction, beginning with Ancient Mesopotamians reading signs in sheep entrails and ending with modern computer simulations for climate, health, wealth, and the fate of our Universe. In this class, you will design your own predictive systems to critically engage with assumptions about how the world works and situate your explorations in a study of how motivations and techniques for divining the future have changed–and not changed–throughout human history.","For more information, please see the Prediction Project website at http://predictionx.org.",Faculty of Arts & Sciences,,,General Education,Lecture,,FAS Letter Graded,Course open to Undergraduate Students Only,Science and Technology in Society,,None

Through direct purchase and through the collecting activity of numerous alumnae/i, we began collecting all sorts of texts and artifacts generated by the medieval world of Arabic, Greek, and Latin civilizations. The things that arrived in Harvard’s collections came in many forms, ranging from great architectural monuments and motifs to little stuff such as belt buckles, pilgrims’ flasks, and fragments of pottery. Why did we want medieval stuff? And what have we since learned about the world from which it came? This is a course about objects and their meaning, focusing on the objects in Harvard’s collections that derive from western Eurasia and North Africa between the fall of the Roman Empire to the eve of contact with the New World. The five modules in the course begin by introducing you to five objects—things, images, texts—in Harvard’s collections. Each of these objects lies on the edges of canonical knowledge and therefore pose mysteries and invite questions. Our own exploration starts with the context of the object’s acquisition and briefly explores what was happening in the world at the moment of its arrival. What did the acquisition of the medieval mean a hundred years ago? From there, we plunge into the past to explore the objects in their own context, working to grasp technologies, economies, social relations, and beliefs. Among other topics, we explore how medieval people imagined saints, miracles and witchcraft, as well as hell and other nasty regions of the afterworld. We explore trade networks and power structures and beliefs about others. We see how medieval peoples mapped visions of their own world, and work our way into the deep inner structures of their cognition, such as their understandings of time and calendar. Starting from the particular and moving to the general, lectures and assignments seek to frame the cultural context of each object and model how students can develop the skills they need to unpack and explain the unfamiliar. A major course-long assignment will invite students to make their own discoveries in Harvard’s collections and elsewhere and to curate their own virtual gallery of objects that engages with the medieval world.

Politicians talk past each other, national policymaking is increasingly calcified, and states pursue wildly diverging policies that frequently contradict, or even directly challenge, one another. Traditionally apolitical policies are politicized. People tune in to separate and distinct information streams from which they receive contradictory messages about what constitute the nation’s problems, and how best to fix them. They increasingly don’t like each other and seem unable or unwilling to communicate across partisan or ideological lines. Policy disagreement becomes personal animus. More Americans embrace seemingly outlandish conspiracy theories, while it grows difficult for even attentive citizens to distinguish truth from falsehood. All of this is reflected in everything from our lifestyles and social interactions to our consumer behaviors to our politics and public policy. How did we get here? And, most important, what can we do about it? This course will explore these questions through the lens of political communication. To do so, we will consider political communication from the perspectives of three sets of actors: the public, the media -- including traditional (e.g., TV, newspaper, radio), partisan (e.g., cable TV news and online) and social (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, etc.) media -- and policymakers/politicians. In each case, we will consider why the actors make the choices they make. Specifically, we will assess the strategic incentives of all three groups of actors (citizens, journalists, policymakers) and how those incentives can interact to produce unanticipated, and sometimes undesirable, consequences. As we begin to understand the nature of political communication and the causes of our current political communication breakdown, we will consider its effects on various aspects of American democracy, from social justice issues, to voting and elections, to public policymaking. Finally, we will explore various possible solutions to some of the most vexing communication-related challenges we face, from eroding trust in democratic institutions, to hyper-polarization to misinformation and conspiracy beliefs.",Also offered by HKS as DPI 608.,Faculty of Arts & Sciences,,,Government,Lecture,,FAS Letter Graded,,,,Social Sciences

Our knowledge of political science would benefit greatly should such a course be made mandatory for all graduate students. This course covers a vast expanse of interesting and rather rare literature across the social sciences, including the philosophy of social science. The reading list was structured around difficult questions that researchers should yet often do not ask themselves, such as ""what are we trying to do here?"", ""why?"", and ""how might it best be done?"" The second week, which covered Popper, Kuhn, and Lakatos was particularly fascinating and provided a great foundation for thinking about the social scientific research enterprise more broadly. The third (on theory–building) and fourth (causality) weeks were also fantastically interesting and novel to me. After delving into these broad questions (and providing a groundwork for conceptualization and measurement), the course tackles specific methodologies—observational studies, experiments, and many weeks on qualitative methodologies that were very interesting as someone whose training in political science fell nearly exclusively into the quantitative camp. This literature and the discussions surrounding it alone provide, in my opinion, sufficient motivation for taking the course. Yet there are two, perhaps even more beneficial aspects of the course that I will now overview. The first key benefit consists of the number of research skills and advise one picks up throughout the course, primarily from Professor Hall's immense experience and erudition, but also from collective discussions of prominent work with colleagues. These tips concern how to write and frame a paper, which elements to prioritize, how to advance an effective and novel argument, what to focus on in your research, how to discover and expand upon initial ideas, etc. All of these are extremely valuable and almost never packaged so precisely and powerfully as they are in this course.  The second key benefit is the remarkable, almost miraculous quantity and quality of feedback you receive on your work from Professor Hall. There is a good deal of work involved in this course (as there should be in a graduate course at our esteemed institution), and essentially all of it is worth your time. In a fraction of the time you are allotted to complete the assignment, Professor Hall will return penetrating feedback on your work that is often longer (and more insightful) than what you originally submitted. His feedback has helped my research immensely and will have altered the direction of my dissertation research for the better. Feedback from kind and sharp peers was also very helpful throughout the term.In sum, the benefits of this course are manifold and unparalleled. Not to avail yourself of such a course would be sheer folly. I am much obliged to Professor Hall and my colleagues, who provided interesting, learned, fun, critical–but–respectful interlocution, for the most enjoyable and fruitful course of my graduate career.",0.9978,,0.0,,0.0,Methods of Political Analysis,GOV 2009,Peter Hall,2026 Spring,Full Term,,,,,,14635,Instructor,,,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,"Covers the issues and techniques central to designing and researching a good dissertation, whether quantitative or qualitative, including principles of research design, case selection, comparison, measurement, and causal relations, with many practical examples.",,Faculty of Arts & Sciences,,,Government,Seminar,,FAS Letter Graded,Course open to Graduate Students Only  (Undergraduates can submit a request to enroll),,,Social Sciences

She is truly the best at cultivating conversations that not only bring the readings to life while also pushing your critical thinking skills.Discussions were genuinely rigorous, readings were always relevant and illuminating, and the final project was a fulfilling challenge to actually put our seminar discussions into practice our discussions by having to think critically in an applied way (since the final projects were shared with the Arboretum to be implemented). If you want to be challenged in a new way as a history concentrator by being pushed to think creatively and practically (I would not recommend this to freshman/sophomores or anyone not already familiar with history), then absolutely take this course. Prof. Miles is one of the few professors on this campus who really cares for you as a person. Yes, she brings snacks to class (which is genuinely a gesture to be grateful for), but she also wants you to come to know yourself more through this course – the course challenged me to think critically about my own morals and future as a historian, because of Prof. Miles's genuine care for how history does, can, and should exist for the public. There were a few times when she asked us at the start of class to reflect about what we want to contribute to the world, and it honestly makes me emotional to remember. It's easy to lose sight of why you're studying at Harvard, but Prof. Miles will not let you forget it.

There was some active eye–rolling when I asked questions even though it was an intro class and so of course you would have questions. They also don’t teach how to use of the software in a very clear way which makes the assignments stressful and hard to figure out. For reference, a metaphor someone else in the class came up with was that this class is like having a paper due before every single class (meets Mondays and Wednesdays) but each time it’s in a new language and instead of being taught the grammar of any of those languages you’re just told everything you did wrong. It’s quite a stressful process but you will become very capable even though there's quite a learning curve.  I wouldn't recommend this class unless you have to take it but you will feel proud of yourself afterwards.",-0.0783,,0.0,Architecture Studio I: Transformations,HAA   96A,"Allie Palmore, Megan Panzano",2026 Spring,Full Term,,,,,,10074,Instructor,,0.0,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,"Architecture assembles multiple models, surfaces, and materials; it is not a single monolithic thing, rather it is comprised of disparate parts and organizational systems operating at different scales.  Design, the bringing together of these elements, requires sensitivity, registers scale, and renders perceptual effect.  This course is an introductory architectural design studio focused on building foundational architectural concepts and design methodologies studied through a process of making.  A series of physical modeling/fabrication assignments explore spatial and organizational transformations as a consequence of the changing interactions among material, fabrication technique, and form.  Resultant expressions of space, scale, and perceptual effects are discussed and evaluated in relation to a series of course readings that frame the intentions of each assignment within architectural theory and history discourse. Both studios in the Architecture Studies Track (Transformations HAA 96A and Connections HAA 96B) explore architectural means and methods of design.  Each begins from a different scale of inquiry, but converges at a similar end.  This studio originates at the scale of material - focusing on specific capacities and effects thereof as well as the details of assembly - and expands from this to an investigation of an occupiable architectural scale in relation to a dynamic site. The course emphasizes fluency in the visual and spatial communication of ideas through instruction in 2D drawing and 3D modeling techniques.  Technical workshops are provided in choreography with serial assignments encompassing drafting and 3D modeling (AutoCAD + Rhino), techniques of fabrication (Rhino to various outputs), 3D printing, and representational processing (Adobe Creative Suite).   The studio exposes students to critical architectural thinking and design methods for more broad disciplinary application following.  No particular skill set, technical or otherwise, is a required prerequisite for this course; students from all backgrounds are welcome.",,Faculty of Arts & Sciences,,,History of Art & Architecture,Studio,,FAS Letter Graded,,,,Arts and Humanities

Throughout the course, we will approach architectural design as both a method of producing urban environments, and also as an avenue through which to understand our cities. We will be directly confronting the social, political, and environmental contexts that are necessarily implicated in any design process.Both studios in the Architecture Studies Track (Transformations HAA 96A and Connections HAA 96B) explore architectural means and methods of design.

Extrapolating abstract principles from these agents, we will be mobilizing the possibilities of architectural representation to reimagine the city through mapping, diagraming, and collage.The studio culminates in a design proposal for a site in Harvard Square.

Each week, we tackle a different method, including surveys, experiments, ethnography, secondary data, text analysis, and formal modeling. In class, students build their understanding and skills as evolutionary social scientists through a combination of empirical paper discussions and hands-on activities.

You are expected to write code on your own which is incredibly difficult without decent exposure to it in class. Brendan and Matt are great, but they have limited office hours and CAs are only helpful if they have had coding experience before and can actually explain it to you.

Taking Math 21a allowed me to have a solid understanding of the content, and I appreciate the amount of effort put into teaching the material. It meets 3 times a week in small class sections, which is by far the best part of the course. Your TF will lecture, and you solve problems with others at your tables or on the chalkboards in small groups – repeating this with the next iteration of new content multiple times in each lecture. This makes it helpful to follow and understand the material. I think you only need AP Calculus AB (or Math 1a) and some self–studying of integration by parts to take this course. It is not hard as long as you take the time to understand the material before the next lecture. The most important piece of advice I have is to not fall behind!The midterm exams were very fair. I never left feeling like I had not studied enough. However, the PSETS and AI Assignments, which I believe were new this semester, were my least favorite part of the course. I am very detail–oriented and try to understand everything for an easier study period when exams come up. As a consequence for me, I spent 4–5 hours on average for most of the PSETS in this course. Some people I know were able to get them done faster. The AI assignments were problematic because the AI tutor simply refuses to tell you if you are on the right track with your answers.Overall, this course is great!",0.951,,0.0,,0.0,Multivariable Calculus,MATH   21A,Eva Politou,2026 Spring,Full Term,,,,,,13284,No Consent,,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"To see how calculus applies in practical situations described by more than one variable, we study integration over curves, surfaces, and solid regions using different coordinate systems; parameterization of curves and surfaces; vectors, lines, and planes; partial derivatives and the gradient; constrained and unconstrained optimization; divergence and curl of vector fields; and the Green's, Stokes's, and Divergence Theorems.There will be required workshops Tuesdays.","Math 21a is taught in small sections throughout the day on a Monday/Wednesday/Friday schedule (9:00-10:15 am, 10:30-11:45 am, 12-1:15 pm, 1:30-2:45 pm, and 3:00-4:15 pm with sufficient enrollment).

That being said, he made a significant number of improvements based on feedback. Here are a few; there are not longer random extra days of class, section is optional now, lectures feel better paced with a bit more time for problems, attendance sheets were simplified and make more sense, the random extra coding/math projects are gone, and so on. It is also clear from the syllabus that Prof. Wood read through the Q guide, identified resources that were particularly helpful to students last semester, and emphasized them this semester. Perhaps the only note I have about this course is that students should really take 22a first, as a lot of 22b draws on concepts from 22a (especially at the beginning of class).  It helps to brush up on 22a materials also, especially if you may have forgotten over winter break or took 22a longer than a semester ago. Other than that, this course is pretty straightforward – grading is to your benefit, classes are easy to follow, and the prof cares a lot and so makes the material interesting (therefore making it easier to learn). This course has 3 midterms (they weren't bad, were graded pretty leniently and the questions made sense). It is proof based, so much of the homework involves writing proofs instead of explicit calculation. Especially compared to 21, this class has only one pset and one brief online assignment per week, making it by and far less stressful (source; the pained looks on the faces of my friends in 21). Teaching staff are nice and available when needed. I felt that I took a lot away from this course, and I would definitely recommend it! (Bonus note; if you are free, the best office hours to go to are Wood's own – he explains stuff better (more effectively and more efficiently) and is super nice. I had classes during his OH this semester, but if you can, definitely go and say hi)",0.9981,"You'll come away from this class proficient in applying Stokes' Theorem, but without much understanding of why we're using said theorem or why we took a certain approach to prove it. You'll learn to perform the calculations, but not truly understand the structure governing multivariable calculus — which is concerning, considering that this is a proof–based course (for reference, I attended every lecture and kept up with the material; I still felt somewhat lost as to the ""why""; maybe also because there are almost zero real–world application problems to see theorems in action). There are also issues with organization. Problem sets have little to nothing to do with exam material, and often require leaps of thinking that necessitate going to office hours to find a very specific approach. Points are also taken off arbitrarily by CAs who were perhaps grading carelessly — but if you confront Dr. Wood about a possible grading mistake, he's extremely unlikely to change it (he'll just try to retroactively justify why the choice was made, even when it's clear that it was a mistake). Exam practice materials are posted extremely late and often come with no solutions and many errors.With that said, the course pack structure — in which Dr. Wood lectures and students follow along in a set of notes containing theorems and practice problems — works well, and the exams aren't unreasonable. A decent option for those looking for a somewhat more rigorous approach to multivariable calculus but aren't interested in spending 20 hours/week on Math 25 or 55.",-0.9663,,0.0,Vector Calculus and Linear Algebra II,MATH   22B,Philip Wood,2026 Spring,Full Term,,,,,,11699,No Consent,,,False,True,False,True,False,True,False,A continuation of Mathematics 22a,,Faculty of Arts & Sciences,,,Mathematics,Lecture,,FAS Letter Graded,"Anti-requisite: Cannot be taken for credit if Math 18A, Math 21A, or AM 22B already complete.",,,Science & Engineering & Applied Science

Yes, the workload was pretty insane at points (prepare for a LOT of all nighters), but you will definitely get through it. You also won't need much content from 55a. There's a bit of algebra when it comes to algebraic topology, but it is completely learnable when you get to that point. There was an in person midterm which was pretty brutal, but it was a small percentage of the grade so it really didn't matter in the end. Most of your grade will be from psets, so if you invest a lot of time into those and find a good group of friends to work on them with, you will be absolutely fine.

Dr. Milberg is a true expert in neuroscience, and his personal experience with some of the patients discussed in class makes the lectures especially engaging. The second half of the course (where students present on landmark cases) is particularly fascinating. You gain a much deeper understanding of patients you may have only briefly encountered in introductory psychology courses.That said, the first portion of the course could benefit from a bit more structure and clarity. I understand it’s challenging to condense an entire neuroscience curriculum into just a few weeks, but it might help to focus primarily on the most essential concepts (such as brain areas and their functions) that are necessary for understanding the cases. Providing more visual materials (maybe through slides or supplemental readings) would also be helpful, especially since students come into this course with varying levels of background. Lastly, a short 5–10 minute break during the two–hour lectures would go a long way since maintaining focus through dense material can be quite tough.Overall, it’s an excellent, low–workload class led by a fantastic professor!",0.9844,,0.0,"Take this class for sure if you’re thinking about doing a MBB secondary (or concentration).

Kudos to them for being very open minded about it and really wanting students to give their feedback. They adjusted PSET length mid–semester which was very fair and they were all overall very open to suggestions even within the course's syllabus. Overall, great teaching coming from Ryan, Hisham, and Jaime.Grading scheme: Loved that there were no exams, making the class very enjoyable and light. Especially if you want to explore something so nuanced and difficult like natural products, not having exams was great. The part about graded on effort I thought was a bit inconsistent with some of the grades I had friends getting given we did the PSETs together and put in the same effort. I think you have to be very clear if it is graded on effort or correctness and if its by effort, have very good feedback so that student understands they got the point for doing the question but have room to understand where they can grow. Also grading highly varied among CAs which is always difficult to understand and unfair, so finding a way to make that more standard is essential, especially if taking the effort–based route because then it just doesn't make sense if the same effort was placed on all PSETs that they wouldn't receive the similar grades.PSETs: The exposure to Pymol and Alphafold is super fun and those PSETs were very enjoyable, whereas the others just seemed very long and tedious. I feel like there are better ways of engaging with the course content than those 10 page PSETS. They did slowly change this up during the semester and condensed into more thought out questions which was great (perhaps just not the last PSET that had 20 pages and most people just dropped it especially because of final project presentations and other finals). I honestly think having more Pymol and Alphafold PSETs would've been a super enjoyable route and very rewarding too building those skills nowadays. Lectures: They leaned much more towards chemistry than bio which would make sense given it says pharmacy in the name of the course but I expected a perhaps more higher overview of the content on the chem side. A focus on understanding why certain plants are explored, their compound effect on the body, classes of plants to explore, etc was what I expected vs learning about terpenoids etc. I think these kinda do walk hand–in–hand so I'd just add that Chem27 is also a pre–req for the class because then the chem part isn't overwhelming and taking away from the experience, despite not having Chem27 hindering my experience completely.  Some of the first PSETs had questions more focused on the chemistry side that which is what we learned in Chem27 4 weeks later or something.Final Project: Super enjoyable putting into practice everything you learned in class and analyzing something of your choice. Highly recommend taking their early deadlines seriously and really planning out what you want to talk about vs last minute cramming because this is meant to be enjoyable and you understanding how your favorite natural product's mechanism and its 3D structure.",0.9983,"It's a really fun class that covers a lot of natural products and molecules!

The weekly workload is just reading a (relatively more complex) research paper and writing a 500–word summary for it. Sometimes it is a bit tricky deciding what to fit into your summary, but it is excellent practice for being concise and getting the broad picture when discussing a complex topic. There are not too many instructions for these assignments, so you have a lot of freedom in terms of how you approach your work. This could be helpful but it can also be confusing exactly what is expected of you. But I would say they are super chill graders, so if you put in decent effort and show you are doing your best to understand and grow, you'll be fine. Besides, you can always reach out with questions and they are usually very fast at answering emails. The quizzes during every class can sound daunting but usually they turn out fine. Just study your materials a bit before class and it shouldn't be a problem. The final presentation at the end of the semester, like all other assignments, were pretty flexible and you are not given that many instructions. So overall, I would just say give all assignments your best effort–––participate in section–––and you will do more than fine. The lack of directions sometimes can feel overwhelming at first, but I think that is supposed to help you and not hurt (or restrict) you too much.  Lastly, the lectures can be very fast–paced and confusing sometimes. The slides could have been more clear and informative for someone who does not know that much about viruses and HIV (the main virus we talk about throughout the semester). A lot of the times, I had to do more research after class to clear up what was discussed during class, but overall, no big problems.",0.9959,,0.0,,0.0,Interplay between Viruses and their Hosts,MCB  165,Victoria D'Souza,2026 Spring,Full Term,,,,,,14637,No Consent,,,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,"This course provides a foray into virology, advanced cell biology, biochemistry and structural biology topics through the lens of viruses as they invade their hosts.

We will study the principles of musical organization (within a range of styles and historical periods) by means of composition projects, score analysis, improvisation, and aural skills. We will begin to think critically about larger topics, such as how music communicates emotion, and how this might change between cultures. No prior experience with music performance or with reading notation is required. Who should take this class? This course is best suited for students with little to no background in music, at least in terms of terminology and notation. Students who are already familiar with the fundamentals of music should consider Music 51a.What will I take away from this class? By the end of the course students will have learnt the basics of music terminology and notation, as well as the norms of Western harmony as far as the composition and analysis of simple chord progressions is concerned. Students will also have gained the experience of writing and performing a few simple pieces of their own.","Department of Music courses in music theory will no longer require students to complete a placement exam. Instead, students are instructed to self-place into music theory course(s) that match their abilities and experience levels at the time of course registration.

The one thing I will say is: do not underestimate the amount of time you have to put into the class. Of course, it is possible to breeze through by barely rehearsing, since the only mandatory thing is a 1 hour weekly coaching (and if your group wants to do this class this way that's totally valid). But after taking this class 4 times, I have realized most groups do actually want to sound good by the final concert, and are pretty serious about rehearsing. For my group, we had regular weekly rehearsals but also extra rehearsals for the performance classes, the final jury, and the final concert, and all that rehearsal time builds up—our group also had extra coaching sessions (so more time again). So ultimately whether this class is a 5th class gem or a pretty substantial class in itself really depends on how serious your group is about sounding good and rehearsing a lot (and note how much your group cares could change DURING the semester). As for the new policy removing pre–formed groups (starting Fall 2025), I understand it may be unpopular—but I agree with the decision. (For context, the status quo is that if you have a pre–formed group, you essentially get into the course automatically, without much consideration to the individual level of the players, and people who applied individually despite essentially being professional–level musicians have gotten rejected due to pre–formed groups having priority). I don't think this is fair, especially for students with professional–level training/performing experience. I think the audition process should be merit–based and not based on social connections and ultimately, whoever is a better musician gets to take the course. Moreover, yes, it is nice to play with your friends, but I think the purpose of a class like this should be personal and musical development. I think playing with people you don’t know—especially ones at a similar level—can actually be a better means to achieve this goal and can challenge you in different and productive ways. Of course, it works when a pre–formed group is compatible, but I believe that the overall pre–forming process often results in several unbalanced groups with players of different levels, resulting in a worse 189 experience for people in these unbalanced groups. I've also seen a fair amount of politicking with the pre–forming process e.g. people trying to “lock in” players early, or abandoning one group for a better one mid–process, which can get messy. I think the staff have a good idea of which players are similar in ability and compatible with others and will ultimately create more balanced groups, resulting in a better overall 189 experience for everyone. The counter of course is that this assumes the staff know better than the students which musicians will be more compatible with each other, which might be difficult in a 10–minute audition. BUT, at least they get to hear everyone directly and assess musical levels side–by–side and for me, that puts them in a better position than students to create balanced, compatible ensembles. Also, stepping back a bit, I don't think the policy is unreasonable—at chamber music festivals the norm is for the organizers/coaches to assign the groups, and in the industry groups are often pieced together last–minute and musicians often have no say in who they play with.Aside from this digression, this is a brilliant course that any classical musician at Harvard should consider taking!

The one thing I will say is: do not underestimate the amount of time you have to put into the class. Of course, it is possible to breeze through by barely rehearsing, since the only mandatory thing is a 1 hour weekly coaching (and if your group wants to do this class this way that's totally valid). But after taking this class 4 times, I have realized most groups do actually want to sound good by the final concert, and are pretty serious about rehearsing. For my group, we had regular weekly rehearsals but also extra rehearsals for the performance classes, the final jury, and the final concert, and all that rehearsal time builds up—our group also had extra coaching sessions (so more time again). So ultimately whether this class is a 5th class gem or a pretty substantial class in itself really depends on how serious your group is about sounding good and rehearsing a lot (and note how much your group cares could change DURING the semester). As for the new policy removing pre–formed groups (starting Fall 2025), I understand it may be unpopular—but I agree with the decision. (For context, the status quo is that if you have a pre–formed group, you essentially get into the course automatically, without much consideration to the individual level of the players, and people who applied individually despite essentially being professional–level musicians have gotten rejected due to pre–formed groups having priority). I don't think this is fair, especially for students with professional–level training/performing experience. I think the audition process should be merit–based and not based on social connections and ultimately, whoever is a better musician gets to take the course. Moreover, yes, it is nice to play with your friends, but I think the purpose of a class like this should be personal and musical development. I think playing with people you don’t know—especially ones at a similar level—can actually be a better means to achieve this goal and can challenge you in different and productive ways. Of course, it works when a pre–formed group is compatible, but I believe that the overall pre–forming process often results in several unbalanced groups with players of different levels, resulting in a worse 189 experience for people in these unbalanced groups. I've also seen a fair amount of politicking with the pre–forming process e.g. people trying to “lock in” players early, or abandoning one group for a better one mid–process, which can get messy. I think the staff have a good idea of which players are similar in ability and compatible with others and will ultimately create more balanced groups, resulting in a better overall 189 experience for everyone. The counter of course is that this assumes the staff know better than the students which musicians will be more compatible with each other, which might be difficult in a 10–minute audition. BUT, at least they get to hear everyone directly and assess musical levels side–by–side and for me, that puts them in a better position than students to create balanced, compatible ensembles. Also, stepping back a bit, I don't think the policy is unreasonable—at chamber music festivals the norm is for the organizers/coaches to assign the groups, and in the industry groups are often pieced together last–minute and musicians often have no say in who they play with.Aside from this digression, this is a brilliant course that any classical musician at Harvard should consider taking!

In concert with investigating the structure, ideologies, and characteristics of expansion of these imperial powers, the archaeological, visual, and epigraphic record will be engaged to give equal focus to the diverse experiences of peoples subjected to such structures of domination. Specific focus is placed on the region of the ancient Levant and the communities therein, exploring their reaction to these imperial programs throughout the late second through first millennium BCE.

I can not tell you exactly what you will learn, since the course is improved upon each semester, but I can tell you that it will be fundamentally fascinating.

Readings included many paper from the original proposal/formulations of quantum mechanics, and section/OH helped a lot with interpretation, so that prior philosophy knowledge requirements were also minimal. Though I took the course as Phil 151, there was a fairly even distribution of people who took it as a physics course, and one could consistently rely on others who had more experience in either physics or philosophy for perspective. The class is small (30ish people), competitive to get into (because the subject and professor are both well liked by students), and takes all years/levels of experience (everything is self contained/taught within the course). This is also a wonderful class for a more logical/formulaic philosophy experience and a more questions/interpretation–based experience physics. I would definitely recommend attending section/OH if possible, the material is fascinating and teaching staff are very willing to discuss related topics. The course generally follows the professors own formulation of quantum mechanics, has no exams (only a final essay), and has only one pset a week (with a reading section and a very straightforward math section).

All three arguments challenge the idea that our ethical beliefs reflect some kind of mind-independent facts. We will begin to develop philosophical skills through close analysis of these arguments, identifying their logical structure and the places where they could be challenged. We will then apply these skills to a series of texts defending alternative metaethical views, including reductive and non-reductive naturalism, quasi-realism, and constructivism. We will explore those four positions and the main challenges for each of them.

I took this class coming off of AP Physics 1, and honestly, I wasn’t sure what to expect. I’d learned the basics, but I was looking for something that would push me further without turning into an all–consuming nightmare. Physical Sciences 12a totally delivered on that. It’s not just a repeat of high school physics—it’s a chance to build on what you already know, dive deeper into some cool stuff like fluid mechanics, and leave with a stronger understanding of physics than you walked in with.It’s also just a great course if you want to understand physics but not dive into the deep end. For someone like me, who’s not majoring in physics but needs a solid foundation for engineering, this class was perfectPros:A Real Review That’s Actually Helpful:Coming from AP Physics 1, I thought I knew the basics. Like, I knew how to do some basic mechanics, forces, and energy problems. But when I jumped into 12a, I realized that there’s a level of depth I hadn’t even touched yet. This course didn’t just breeze through what I already knew—it helped me really understand it. Fluid mechanics was a whole new world for me, and I got to see how the math and concepts actually fit together. Honestly, I walked out of this class with a much better grasp of physics than I had going in.Demos & Labs: Total Game Changer:Let’s be real, I didn’t expect the demos to be as entertaining as they were. They were straight–up cool. We didn’t just watch some pendulum swing back and forth—these demos brought the physics to life in ways that made everything feel real. And the labs? They weren’t just a way to pass time. I actually enjoyed them. I got to team up with people, test out theories, and see how physics works in the real world. It wasn’t some dry, boring “let’s just get this done” experience—it was genuinely fun. Plus, the labs were a good way to meet people, so there’s that bonus.Stars System: Not Perfect, But Solid:I was a little skeptical about the Stars system at first, but once I got into it, I saw how it helped me stay on top of the material. The idea is simple: prove you know your stuff, earn a Star. It gives you smaller, more manageable goals to work toward instead of one big exam stress fest. Now, I’m not gonna lie, the Stars system can be intense. If you mess up even a little bit, you miss the Star. But there’s a silver lining: if you miss a Star, you can meet with the course leadership to show that you’ve got a handle on the material. It’s kind of like an insurance policy—you get another shot to prove you know your stuff. This kept me from panicking about exams and helped me focus on actually learning.Incredible Support from the Course Leadership:One of my favorite things about this class was the course leadership. They weren’t just checking boxes—they actually cared that you understood the material. Any time I had a question or felt like I was falling behind, they were there to help. It wasn’t some generic “go to office hours” vibe; they’d actually meet with you one–on–one, break down concepts until they clicked, and make sure you were on the right track. It was refreshing, especially in a course that’s got some heavy material.Confidence Boost Like No Other:Before this course, I felt like I understood physics, but not in the deep way I wanted to.

If you want an answer to the question ""what were your top 5 most favorite classes you took throughout all college?"" this should be top 3, if not the first.  This class is MIT's equivalent of ""how to build almost everything"", and you're not missing out by not taking the MIT version: this is seriously one of the best courses offered here.My background: CS/Econ.  Almost no 'building–hardware' experience but wanted to explore that.You get to work with a small group of people, which I think really adds to the vibe.  The staff and teaching fellows are super fun to hang around and are very easy to ask questions to.  What's kind of funny is that the lab is in the science center (SC 102) and visitors will come by to look in at the work you're doing.  Feels like you're on display, which some may not like, but I actually loved it because it felt cool to show off what you've been working on![What I Learned]The course site essentially describes all of this, but I'll put it here:– Microcontroller programming– CNC Milling (wood, acrylic, foam)– Laser Cutting (wood, acrylic)– Metalwork– Circuitry fundamentals (capacitors, resistors, breadboards)– Inputs/outputs you can attach to the circuit (servos and other actuators, stepper/DC motors, Piezo buzzers, RFID scanners, light displays, and so much more)– Circuit board fabrication (PCBs)– Radio communication (wired, wireless, Bluetooth)[Typical Week]– You'll be given a project to work on Tuesday, then have until the following Thursday to complete it.– If you don't complete it to the level you desire, you're free to redo it or continue on it until the end of the semester, but I advise just moving on and focusing on the next weekly task, then go back to that one at the end, that way you're not feeling lagged behind by any means.– The workload each week is not the same.  Some projects will take longer.  Of all the weeks, I think the heaviest weeks are: kinetic sculpture, radio communication, and machine building (robot machine).  Those weeks take about 10 hours.Again, PLEASE TAKE THIS COURSE IF YOU WANNA DO HANDS ON WORK.  This stuff is so fun.  I know I say 10 hours for the worst weeks but honestly it does not even feel like 10 weeks, it's more like ""an hour of work here"" and ""two hours of work there"", what's nice is you can basically come in any time with a buddy and they have so many office hours it's quite ridiculous, there's never a shortage of that.

Students will learn to safely use software and hardware to fabricate programmable projects. Tools and topics will include programmable microcontrollers, 3D CAD/CAM, electronic circuit design, and wireless networking (Internet of Things). Additionally, students will learn operational principles for techniques such as laser cutting, 3D printing, and computer-controlled milling. The course will culminate with an individual final project of the student’s own conception, integrating as many of the weekly topics as possible. The course emphasizes self-directed learning, and supports students in accessing resources to help advance the development of their unique projects. Applications may include personal fabrication, product prototyping, fine arts, and the creation of scientific research tools. Students will document work on each weekly topic in a personal website, thereby finishing the course with an online portfolio that not only illustrates their new skill sets, but also contributes to a collective repository of knowledge that serves as a foundation for continued learning.Course website: https://tinyurl.com/tasr7b6Related Sections: In addition to class times, students enroll in a lab section where they will interact with course staff for hands-on assignment work.

In a typical math course, we learn techniques and kind of problems, but there's a lot of theory and explanation surrounding it. It's not that the course fails to give you a solid theoretical grounding, but it's less concerned with rigor, giving you enough of an intro to understand the motivation behind a formula without exhaustive justification of our methods. But because of this, you can cover SO MUCH. For example, I took Math 113 and learned wonderful things, but in terms of how to solve actual problems in the field, a week of this course taught me 80% of a semester of Math 113. And the math is SO relevant for a physicist. I was taking 143A at the same time and often I'd learn a subject in 106 then have to apply it or derive it in 143A a week later.

I can not tell you exactly what you will learn, since the course is improved upon each semester, but I can tell you that it will be fundamentally fascinating. We spent the first half of the semester essentially rederiving linear algebra, and the second rederiving all of the axioms of quantum mechanics, all from base principles with very little prior math knowledge needed. Readings included many paper from the original proposal/formulations of quantum mechanics, and section/OH helped a lot with interpretation, so that prior philosophy knowledge requirements were also minimal. Though I took the course as Phil 151, there was a fairly even distribution of people who took it as a physics course, and one could consistently rely on others who had more experience in either physics or philosophy for perspective. The class is small (30ish people), competitive to get into (because the subject and professor are both well liked by students), and takes all years/levels of experience (everything is self contained/taught within the course). This is also a wonderful class for a more logical/formulaic philosophy experience and a more questions/interpretation–based experience physics. I would definitely recommend attending section/OH if possible, the material is fascinating and teaching staff are very willing to discuss related topics. The course generally follows the professors own formulation of quantum mechanics, has no exams (only a final essay), and has only one pset a week (with a reading section and a very straightforward math section).

Although Girma is not the clearest of lecturers, this is compensated by his boundless enthusiasm and love for electrodynamics which he radiates (no EM pun intended) at every lecture! Girma is a very accessible instructor whom you can ask any question without fear of judgment, and it was always a pleasure to attend his office hours during which I gained a lot of physical insight. The subject–matter of the course — electrodynamics — is an extremely beautiful subject, and knowledge and mastery thereof is crucial to any budding theoretical physicist. Unfortunately, we did not cover the entirety of Griffiths in sufficient depth due to temporal constraints — which is a shame — but in future renditions of the course, this can be easily remedied by adding a third lecture every week. In terms of prior background and preparation, 153 is a self–contained course that builds up the theory of classical electrodynamics from scratch, so you really do not need a ton of prior knowledge in EM (contrary to what the course prerequisites might say). That being said, such knowledge is useful insofar as it makes the fast pace of 153 more manageable. Personally, I came into the class with only AP Physics C and physics 19 under my belt and did just fine (incidentally, this just goes to show that physics 16 really is unnecessary for more advanced courses like 153). If you're considering taking 153, my suggestion would be to study chapter 1 of Griffiths over winter break if you have never seen multi–variable calculus before. If you have time, you should also take a look at chapters 2 and 3 just so that you don't get lost in the first few weeks. To end this QGuide, I'd like to give some advice on how to get the most out of 153 during the semester. Besides going to all the lectures, I strongly recommend that you read Griffiths (by read, I mean read it religiously). Due to lack of time, I did not read Griffiths in its entirety, which in hindsight I regret given the phenomenal amount of physical insight that this book contains. I think the best strategy is to read Girma's lecture notes before coming to lecture to get a brief overview of the material that will be covered (otherwise, you will easily get lost, because oftentimes Girma skips a lot of the mathematical steps and refers you to the lecture notes), and then after lecture you can read the corresponding sections/chapters in Griffiths to solidify your understanding. I cannot stress the importance of doing this, because with the take–home format of the exams, it is very easy to get away with fragmented understanding of the material, whereas what you should be aiming for is a robust grasp on electrodynamics. TL;DR: Fantastic course, beautiful material, wonderful instructor. Not a lot of background is required. Just read the first chapter(s) of Griffiths over winter break, and make an effort to read the textbook throughout the semester to get the most out of this course.",0.9966,"I would describe this course as a mathematical methods course for physics.

First of all, the teaching staff: Professor Schwartz is deeply passionate about the material and teaching as such. He truly wants you to understand statistical mechanics and how to apply it to whatever interests you. He is also accessible outside of class and will explain concepts to you. He is very knowledgeable in many areas of physics and thus a great teacher for this course. The only criticism I have is that the lectures can be somewhat hard to follow at times due to notation inconsistent with the lecture notes or minor notational mistakes. Further the lectures do not comprehensively cover the lecture notes. This is, however, despite what the naysayers falsely have proclaimed, proclaim in this Q and will proclaim ad infinitum not an issue as you have the SUPERB LECTURE NOTES to rely on. They provide detailed derivations of the material and are more than comprehensive.With regards to assignments, the course is relatively easy. There are weekly PSETS that (once again ignore the naysayers) are easy to do with the lecture notes and support from your friends: ChatGPT and Gemini. Yes you heard correctly: generative AI is allowed and its usage is even encouraged in this glorious class. This is part of professor Schwartz's educational doctrine, which I'm very much in support of. Ample extra credit opportunities (such as tempering chocolate) give you a chance to make up for any minor mistakes that happened. Lastly there is a take–home midterm and final, which by their very nature are easy to do. Overall I'm very happy to have taken the course as a Chemistry major over the alternatives the Chemistry department has to offer. There are no pre–requisites. I have not taken any quantum or any proper mechanics. High–school math and physics is all you need, anything else can be learned along the way. The course covers many interesting topics from the basics of stat. mech. over tedious thermodynamics (my hatred has only increased) to interesting applications in semiconductor physics and astrophysics. Once again do not listen to the overly critical voices in this year's Q. From first–hand knowledge I can attest that many of these naysayers did not read the lecture notes or attend lectures, which indeed causes a challenge in understanding the material.",0.9935,Very bashy.

Jordan has set the new standard for teaching 210, par excellence. His deep understanding of general relativity, combined with his philosophical perspective, created a class where I did not merely learn how to compute a bunch of metrics, but to ponder the deep mystery of space and time. Jordan declared his thesis statement at the beginning of the first lecture: Einstein's theory of general relativity gives the definitive explanation of the nature of space and time, a question which had provoked thought for millennia. He developed this thesis throughout the semester. It is my understanding that by the end of February we had covered what past renditions of 210 take the entire semester to do. Despite this, Jordan's lectures felt appropriately paced and incredibly insightful.I especially appreciate how the second half of the course was devoted to topics and applications in GR. Jordan's conjuring of the Ghosts of Universes Past, Present, and Yet–to–Come in the series on cosmology was particularly beautiful. The final lecture may have been the greatest of them all. What I will remember most from this course are the parting words Jordan left for us at the end of the final class. He shared two quotes, one from Einstein and another from Wittgenstein, which were a fitting chiasmus to his opening remarks at the start of the semester. General relativity provides an outlet for wonder more than anything else. It is a theory of singular beauty, yet one which retains a quality bordering on the mystical a century after its inception. That space and time so desperately want to be equals yet are forever distinguished by a single minus sign really makes you wonder. The curvature of spacetime flies in the face of common intuition. Plato writes that what distinguishes knowledge from mere belief is the ability to peer into the realm of Forms and see the underlying, unchanging nature of things. This class teaches you knowledge of the real nature of space, time, matter, and indeed the universe itself. I looked forward to this class every Monday and Wednesday, and hope to cross paths with Jordan again in the future, if our world lines intersect. The Physics Department has done a great job at hiring new faculty in the past few years.

As someone who's kind of obsessed with the social environment surrounding mental illness, this was one of my favorite classes I've taken at Harvard, and I loved talking with other people who think about it as much as I do, but it might not be everyone's cup of tea.

It will consider classic works such as Durkheim’s On Suicide, Foucault’s Madness & Civilization, Freud’s Civilization & It’s Discontents, Fanon’s Wretched of the Earth and Kleinman’s Patients & Healers. We will ask how these theories relate to vexing modern problems at the interface between society mental health including the opioid epidemic, deaths of despair and teen mental distress. We will also consider problems in subjective wellbeing, such as why humans do not seem to be happier with the material progress of commercial society (the Easterlin Paradox). The course begins with the challenges: an overview of biomedical and epidemiological consensus on mental illness classification, risk factors, and known epidemiological characteristics. It moves through a close reading of how several key social theorists have located and characterized important relationships between mental health and society, building on the study of these thinkers in Social Studies 10. It then considers important ethnographic work from Anne Becker, Philippe Bourgois, and Matthew Desmond, in addition to econometric approaches from Anne Case, Angus Deaton and David Cutler. The course concludes with the present puzzles as presented by leaders in contemporary biological psychiatry and healthcare delivery (Thomas Insel), with reflections on the way forward in conceptualizing these biosocial processes. The tutorial instructor is a graduate of the Social Studies program, holds an MD-PhD in Economics from Harvard, and is a practicing psychiatrist on the faculty of Mass General Brigham McLean Hospital and Harvard Medical School.",This course will be lotteried and is open to non-concentrators if space permits.,Faculty of Arts & Sciences,,,Social Studies,Tutorial,,FAS Letter Graded,,,,

That's a fine choice, in my view, and very possibly even the right one, given the advent of LLMs that can help you figure out how to do relatively simple programming, which is all most people in the course will ever need to do with R. My major problem with this course — and it was a ~really~ major problem for me — was that it was totally inconsistent in aligning policies, practices, and assignments with this (seeming) emphasis.In lecture, we almost exclusively learned about statistics, with only very brief discussion of how we apply the concepts from lecture in R. If you consult the lectures slides, most of which ran between 40 and 60 slides, you’d find that perhaps four or five contain any code whatsoever, and after the first week or two, we received zero instruction in how to code ‘well’ — good syntax, in–line commenting, etc.I found it confusing, then, that our problem sets were ~exclusively~ in R, often involving only relatively trivial applications of the math we learned in lecture. For most problem sets, I spent substantially more time trying to figure out how to do something in R than considering how to solve the problem. There’s nothing per se wrong with that, but it was clearly out of step with the lectures, and as such it created lots of confusion, frustration, and discouragement for students, and less learning than a different approach might’ve.I was especially frustrated when the midterm rolled around, because it was exclusively pen–and–paper math with no coding in R. That’s fine and probably actually good for a class focusing on statistics — I learned a lot from it and found it rigorous — but it was the first time we’d been asked to apply stats concepts flexibly in complicated scenarios, which the problem sets basically did not have us do. I was really frustrated studying for the midterm, for this reason, and I did well, but many of my classmates did not.The final exam, perplexingly and with no real warning, changed the focus yet again. It was divided into two halves — one in R, one on paper — and the computer section was dramatically harder than the paper math section. In significant part, the computer section was much harder because we had hardly been taught how to code by the course and had never had to code without access to lecture notes, office hours, and LLMs that can advise on programming basics, so many students simply couldn’t execute certain things in R. Meanwhile, the paper section was almost trivially easy, much easier than the midterm, and only required about half the allotted 90 minutes. There were also some more run–of–the–mill problems that bear noting. In particular, I found lectures did not add much value over reading the slides, though I attended almost all lectures. There was, in my opinion, too little elaboration about some really key concepts (we never received explanation about what a t–distribution is, even though t–distributions followed us through like half the course). There was also a lot of unintroduced math terminology that I have to imagine confused people who have taken little–to–no college math, which is many people in this course. Finally, I really think well–known courses owe it to students to announce that they’re changing their focus when they are: I would probably have taken this course anyway if I knew it was going to emphasize statistics more heavily, but that probably wouldn’t have been the case for some others.",-0.9426,Take this class if you want a gem that fulfills your scientific reasoning requirement.

I'll discuss the pros and cons of this class, and why you might (not) want to choose it over 139/244. This review will be quite long but should answer basically any question you have about the course and be sufficient to decide whether it is a course that you'd like to take.Required preparation: You can do well in this class even if your only preparation is STAT 110. We do use likelihoods and MLEs quite a bit throughout the class, so 111 would definitely be helpful, but is not completely necessary. Presumably you're taking this class if you're a stat concentrator though, so you will have probably taken 111 anyway. Lastly, 139 is by no means needed for this class, hence why 149 can substitute for it in the modeling requirement for the stats concentration. I think around half of the people in 149 this semester did not take 139. However, I would strongly recommend taking 139 as well if you plan to take this course, as it really does not make conceptual sense to learn basically every type of generalized linear model except for a standard linear regression with normally–distributed errors (which is the focus of 139). This course will also be far more satisfying having completed 139 and you will be able to more clearly see why we are doing certain things. Some topics are also retaught from scratch from 139, so you'll be slightly ahead having completed that before this course.Content: The course covers different generalized linear models (e.g. logistic regression, Poisson regression, multinomial regression) as well as some extensions beyond these models, including some more ML–related topics (smoothers, GAMs, decision trees) and related non–GLMs (negative binomial, beta–binomial, proportional odds). The theoretical basis for this class is rooted in exponential dispersion families (essentially NEFs if you remember those from 111), and their log–likelihoods/MLEs. We touch on topics such as model selection, diagnostics, and missing data methods as well.Course structure: Mark is a great professor and is very well–organized. Lecture notes are well–written and contain basically everything you need to complete the homeworks and do well on exams. If you don't want to attend a 9 AM lecture twice a week, the lecture notes (or the Panopto recording) are entirely sufficient. In fact, you can complete nearly everything on the homework assignments solely with the lecture notes (and associated R script provided on Canvas). Lecture notes and homeworks will be posted far in advance in contrast to some other stats courses where homeworks are released late or not at all. There are office hours and sections provided, though sections were sparsely attended since the lecture notes are so well–written and self–contained, and since the course enrollment was relatively small. If you come to lecture or watch the recordings, you will probably not need to go to section.Homeworks: There are 6 regular homework assignments throughout the semester, due roughly every other week on Monday. As I mentioned, they can be completed basically with just the lecture notes. They are mostly applied and in R, though there will occasionally be more theoretical questions. However, these assignments are very straightforward and should not require that much stress or time. Mark guides you through the applied problems and so you'll almost never have to look up an obscure command to do something. These assignments should take no more than 2 or 3 hours if you're referring to the lecture notes for guidance.Mini–projects: In addition to the 6 regular homeworks, there are also 3 ""mini–projects"" which are really just additional psets, but the mini–projects have you explore one dataset 3 times throughout the second half of the semester to implement tools as we learn them in class. So in reality this class has 9 homework assignments, but these mini–projects are slightly shorter than regular homeworks and usually due in the weeks in between the due dates of two homeworks. They also only start in the second half of the class, following spring break and the first midterm.Exams: This class has 2 exams: a midterm and a final. However, it's more accurate to describe them as Midterm 1 and Midterm 2, as they are both the same length (75 minutes). Midterm 2 is notably not cumulative which is why it is still only 75 minutes long (though still held during finals period), though in reality you learn so many more things in the second half of the class that it not being cumulative doesn't really change anything, and you will still need to have a strong understanding of many of the concepts from the first half anyway. The exams are not really that tricky and mostly test interpretation of model outputs and related concepts. There are some theoretical concepts covered on exams, though no more so than computing a log likelihood or an MLE. However, there are some more obscure formulas required to complete certain parts that are not provided to you, so it's a good thing that you're allowed to bring in a cheat sheet for the exams. Make sure that you make a good cheat sheet or you may lose out on a large number of points because you didn't have the right formula written down on your cheat sheet (i.e. Newton–Raphson or an F test statistic). Exam averages hovered around 70 percent, not too much different from 110/111, though the exams in this class were definitely far easier and more predictable than those. If you take the practice exams, review the lecture notes, and make a good cheat sheet, you should be fine.Grade distribution: About half the class gets a final grade in the A range, and about half in the B range. But again, if you put in a decent level of effort and stay on top of the class, you should be able to get an A range grade. Mark is very fair in how he determines and curves grades, so it is really only if you are unable or unwilling to dedicate enough time and effort to the class (which is again, far less than 110/111) that you would do worse than you'd have liked to.Overall workload: I rarely spent more than 2 or 3 hours each week outside of class on 149. Homework assignments were very straightforward and could be quickly completed using the lecture notes. This workload increased the weeks of the two exams, though you probably don't need to do much more than review the lecture notes and homeworks, make your cheat sheet, and complete the practice exams.Now that I've summarized the class, I'll address whether one should take it over 139 or 244.139  vs 149: 149 is essentially an extension of 139 and allows for far more flexibility in modeling than what 139 does with OLS regression. That being said, 149 can reasonably be taken without any knowledge from 139 and is actually an easier/less time consuming class than 139 (you can verify this by comparing Q guides). So if you just want to get this modeling requirement out of the way and maybe if you have a very busy fall schedule, 149 may be preferable. But if you want to have a complete, widely–applicable knowledge base of understanding, you'd be best off taking both 139 and 149. While there are some redundancies between the two, taking both gives you basically everything you need to statistically model basically anything. Another little–discussed note of importance is that 149 is approved as an Econ elective (as of Spring 2025) while 139 is not, which may be of interest to Stat–Econ double concentrators.149 vs 244: 149 is a very applied class and does not get too much into the weeds of the more theoretical concepts. It is mainly focused on interpreting results and choosing the appropriate model. While this means 149 is very applicable, if you're more theory–oriented you may want to take 244 instead, which combines 139 and 149 into one graduate–level class heavy in linear algebra, calculus, and proofs. It also meets the modeling requirement, but does not cover all of the application discussed in 139 and 149. So I'd recommend 244 only if you're more interested in the theory (and perhaps going for advanced course track honors/concurrent masters). Though you can of course take 139/149 and then take 244 as well if you'd like, which is what I plan to do.Overall, you should consider taking 149 if you want a low–stress yet extremely useful class where you'll learn a lot without having the class feel like a burden on your schedule.",0.998,,0.0,,0.0,Introduction to Generalized Linear Models,STAT  149,Mark Glickman,2026 Spring,Full Term,,,,,,10449,No Consent,,,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,"Sequel to Statistics 139, emphasizing common methods for analyzing continuous non-normal and categorical data.

The psets are manageable towards the end they just became textbook problems which are significantly easier, and there are lots of office hours and support. I will say that sometimes it was hard to get a clear gauge on what the exams would be like, because there would be challenging content in lecture, then easy things on the psets, and then medium questions on the section notes, and then really hard practice exam problems so it was unclear what we should be preparing for and what the expectations for the exam actually were.

So here are my thoughts (mostly for undergrads, PhDs are welcome to skip this essay as you are forced to take this class):My preparation: I am a junior who took Math 25A/B, Stat 210, and 211. I had not taken Stat 212 or any other math course before taking 213. I don’t think a deep understanding of measure theory is really needed for this course, but I’m sure it helps if you have one.Material: 4.6/5. The material is very foundational and if you are very interested in statistics (which you probably are given you are reading the 213 Qguide in the first place), you will love it. The course is broadly divided into three parts: estimation (the longest one comprising most of the semester), hypothesis test, and Bayesian inference (which lasts for about a week).Starting with estimation, the first few weeks on the unit can be rather dry. In the words of Pragya herself, she doesn’t exactly like the material in these weeks due to them feeling more analysis–y than statistics–y and I completely agree; the number of assumptions in some theorems is so large that they become a pain to check through whenever you are working on homework. I don’t think these weeks were bad by any means, but they were definitely not the best either.These problems mostly end by the time we discuss QMD, which may seem like the bashiest, why–does–this–exist definition when you first learn them, but you will quickly learn how useful they are for the rest of the semester; it’s actually astonishing how much QMD gets used as the most important assumption in so many theorems despite how ugly the definition is. So the estimation unit is basically divided into two halves: the first half which is dry and the second half which utilizes QMD. So if you have hatred for analysis, you may not like the course at the beginning, but I do promise that it will get better as it goes on.For the hypothesis test unit, Pragya does a great job at explaining why we should test the asymptotic power of different hypothesis testing methods using an alternative that gets harder and harder as the sample size increases. The motivation is great, and using LeCam’s Third Lemma to get results for this is pretty satisfying. The one issue I had however is that we don’t exactly derive many ways to get the asymptotic power under the alternatives in class nor in the notes. For example, for the Likelihood–Ratio Test, we learned about the asymptotic distribution of the test statistic under the null, but we didn’t really discuss what happens under a sequence of alternatives except in the problem set where we did it only for the Gaussian case. It would have been helpful to better integrate the measure theory that came before this because as it stands, it doesn’t feel like I learned that much about how to find the power under sequences of alternatives. Nonetheless, a great unit; also extending the idea of a most powerful test to an asymptotically most powerful test was very interesting.Finally, for the Bayesian unit: It needs to be longer. One week of Bayesian statistics that virtually only aims to prove the Bernstein–von–Mises Theorem really doesn’t provide much at all for Bayesian statistics. I do get that this is supposed to be a foundational course and statistics began mostly from a frequentist perspective, but I definitely think that as a class that is supposed to prepare PhDs for research, it should give a wider view of Bayesian inference. This may be difficult to do since the material is pretty packed already, but I definitely think that the estimation unit was too long and some parts of it (example: perhaps proof of asymptotic normality of MLE? It is an important result but the proof was long and felt unmotivated for the most part.) can be cut to give some more room for Bayesian stuff. I enjoyed what existed of Bayesian inference in the course nevertheless.Lectures: 4.8/5. Pragya is a great lecturer and makes it incredibly obvious that she knows what she is talking about. She also occasionally makes jokes that integrate into what she was talking about perfectly, which gives the lectures a little spark that I’ve only seen Pragya be able to accomplish. The only complaint I have is that the lectures can be a bit dry sometimes (especially in the estimation unit), but this mostly just occurs on topics that are dry in the first place.Problem Sets: 4.3/5. There are biweekly problem sets, and there are 5 total with one drop. Let me make this clear: Unless you are more of a math major than a statistics major (even then I feel this may apply), Stat 213 is NOT easier than Stat 211. The problem sets are less of “find the one hard–to–see trick” that Stat 211 often employed. The difficulty of Stat 213 homework comes from the difficulty of the material itself (not to say Stat 211 had easy material, but it was definitely easier than 213). Stat 213 material is packed and we don’t go over applications to all of the theorems; these applications are moved to the problem sets, and this can make the homework very difficult. This isn’t really problematic, but just something you should be aware of going into this course. As for grading, I would sometimes lose points for “formality,” but I’m not sure exactly where the formality points lie as they can be very subjective and the staff solutions can seem short and less formal as well. Another thing to be aware of.One thing I should mention though: I utterly failed to befriend PhD students in this class, so I basically worked on the problem sets alone. I’m sure the homework is a lot easier if you are less introverted than me and actually get to know some PhD students lol.However, one big problem that makes my opinion of problem sets be lower than it deserves: The first two problems in the fourth assignment were in the section notes. I didn’t realize this, so I basically had to solve this from scratch. This leads to two outcomes, both of which are problematic: 1. Someone who didn’t read the section notes tries to solve the problem. Then they are disadvantaged by those who did read it. 2. Someone who did read the section notes copies the solution. Then they are disadvantaged by the fact they didn’t really learn from the problem. Either way, this is a problem; I strongly believe that no problem presented in section should be on the homework. These two problems weren’t exactly the hardest problems in problem sets so it isn’t as bad as it could have been, but something to keep in mind for the course heading forward.My advice for undergrads: TL;DR: If you are in the following set, I would recommend taking the course:{Took analysis} \cap (({Interested in stats} \cap {Took measure theory}) \cup {REALLY interested in stats}) \cap {Have time for this course}. I was in the {REALLY interested in stats} set and not in the {Took measure theory} set (which made it more challenging for me), and I have no regrets about taking this course. It’s very foundational and the material is legitimately interesting. I still love the way sequences of more difficult alternative hypotheses were presented as well as how much QMD can be used for good results. If you really love statistics, I can’t see yourself not enjoying this course. So unless you think this course will be too much of a hassle with your schedule, take it! I would also recommend taking it your sophomore/junior year as it can be difficult to manage this your senior year especially if you want to write a thesis. But definitely have a Plan B in case you find this class to be overwhelming.And be warned: There are 24 hour take–home midterm and final, and those are brutal.That concludes my essay. Hopefully any undergrads reading this found it helpful.For Pragya: Thank you for a great semester! I’m sure I wasn’t the most talented undergrad you’ve had during your time teaching this course (I would actually bet I’m the least talented undergrad you’ve had in this course lol), but I truly enjoyed Stat 213 and the material was so interesting. I got a lot out of this class, and I hope you continue to teach Stat 213 as you are amazing!",0.999,"If you want to learn M and Z–estimation theory, local asymptotics, local testing, etc., and why they're useful, this class is a good excuse to do so.  Do note that you will mostly be teaching yourself these materials as the professor's presentation and TF were not particularly helpful. For the poor STAT department students who have to take this class as part of their qualifying exam material, my sympathy goes out to you. Also something is seriously wrong in the STAT department that the gender breakdown of this class was over 20 male students with only 3 women taking the class...  Speaking to some of the students about it, people told me that many people warned them not to apply to the Harvard Statistics department as a woman.

She does a great job of breaking down content in a way that is palatable, but also leaves you wanting to know more. I have learned so much in this class, from experimental techniques, developmental pathways, and even socioeconomic factors about reproductive biology – things like misogyny in science, to intersex/transgender healthcare, and more. If you haven't taken SCRB 10/SCRB 50, the first couple of weeks are a great crash course for experimental design, which is important for PSETs. Lecture is much more informational (but still very interesting!). PSETs are very manageable, as long as you take the time to show up to office hours (there is no collaboration with peers allowed, only TFs/Kara). The TFs were also both very amazing, approachable, and dedicated people! Lastly, if youre reading this lottery ASAP for the course – it's very hard to get into, so if you demonstrate interest early, you have a higher chance of getting into the class earlier. The majority of the class was juniors/seniors, and they are from a good mix of backgrounds (mostly premed, but not all HDRB).

How does one situate performance historically and from a theoretical perspective?  And how can performance become a critical tool to engage cultural, political, and philosophical issues?You will be encouraged to develop your ability to think about performance from many different perspectives and to defend your individual ideas with strong critical skills.

In this course, we will explore how a wide range of contemporary choreographers are building on, rejecting, and transforming the formal techniques, concepts and ideas, and social and political projects of dance artists who came before them. How are today’s choreographers using history to generate art that poses new questions, tests the boundaries of dance and performance, and resonates with audiences now?Each week, we will study the work of a contemporary choreographer side-by-side with that of a major figure in dance history who influenced them. Traversing a range of styles, we will learn about these artists’ biographies, creative projects, and broader cultural contexts, and consider how they are in conversation across time and space. Examining dance films, images, memoirs, interviews with artists, and live performances, we will practice describing and analyzing movement as scholars and critics. Artists will include Justin Peck and Jerome Robbins, Jamar Roberts and Alvin Ailey, Pam Tanowitz and Merce Cunningham, Ayodele Casel and Juanita Pitts, and more.","No prior experience with dance is necessary to enroll.

Within Malian ideology, dance is a culture and there is no separation between dance and theatrical practice. Koteba is a masquerade performance tradition that utilizes the theatrical elements of satire to comment on and confront civic injustices within the Bamana ethnic society. Koteba is a word that means “big snail” in the Bamana language, and like the snail, it carries the ideologies and cosmologies of the Bamana people on its back. There are nearly 20 rhythm and movement stylings situated within Koteba. In a multiday festival, these dances are traditionally performed in succession, and often executed with the dancers forming concentric circles, which gives this theater tradition its snail-like name. Traces of this masquerade tradition can be found throughout the Caribbean and the United States in the form of Carnival and Mardi Gras.This class will focus on unpacking four of the dance and rhythm stylings over the course of 12 weeks: (1) Forokotoba, (2) Tansole, and (3) Bara/Baradong. The traditions of Noh drama, Sanskrit theater, and Greek tragedy have informed the development of American dance and theatrical forms, and similarly, a deep investigation of Koteba masquerade performance traditions will offer students of theater and dance informative tools as theorists, practitioners and historians.","Visit the Canvas course page for enrollment information and deadlines.

How do political and social arrangements of labor help produce and reinforce racial categories while solidifying the boundaries separating masculinity and femininity? Through a mix of primary and secondary sources, this seminar explores histories of emotional labor and the power structures that give meaning to often taken-for-granted categories of work.
