Do not be afraid, choose a topic you care about, and embrace the ups and downs! Some advice I have for future thesis writers \u2026 1. Choose a project or topic that means something to you (i.e. a physical location \/ earth system you\u2019re interested in, a project with policy implications you care about, a methodology that would be challenging but rewarding for you to master). I found this went a long way in energizing me to work on my thesis. 2. Think about when you\u2019ll have pockets of time to really focus on your thesis. For me, it was helpful to carve out designated days or couple day stretches to put other things aside and really focus on my thesis (senior year winter break was an especially important stretch for me). Also, choose a designated thesis cave location (thank you Peet\u2019s Coffee and Ernst Mayr library)! 3. Reading as much of the existing literature on your topic as possible will help you gain confidence and feel like the project is your own. I felt like I gained the most traction with my thesis when I started actively bringing new ideas and questions to meetings with my advisors. 4.

The one thing I will say is: do not underestimate the amount of time you have to put into the class. Of course, it is possible to breeze through by barely rehearsing, since the only mandatory thing is a 1 hour weekly coaching (and if your group wants to do this class this way that's totally valid). But after taking this class 4 times, I have realized most groups do actually want to sound good by the final concert, and are pretty serious about rehearsing. For my group, we had regular weekly rehearsals but also extra rehearsals for the performance classes, the final jury, and the final concert, and all that rehearsal time builds up\u2014our group also had extra coaching sessions (so more time again). So ultimately whether this class is a 5th class gem or a pretty substantial class in itself really depends on how serious your group is about sounding good and rehearsing a lot (and note how much your group cares could change DURING the semester). As for the new policy removing pre\u2013formed groups (starting Fall 2025), I understand it may be unpopular\u2014but I agree with the decision. (For context, the status quo is that if you have a pre\u2013formed group, you essentially get into the course automatically, without much consideration to the individual level of the players, and people who applied individually despite essentially being professional\u2013level musicians have gotten rejected due to pre\u2013formed groups having priority). I don't think this is fair, especially for students with professional\u2013level training\/performing experience. I think the audition process should be merit\u2013based and not based on social connections and ultimately, whoever is a better musician gets to take the course. Moreover, yes, it is nice to play with your friends, but I think the purpose of a class like this should be personal and musical development. I think playing with people you don\u2019t know\u2014especially ones at a similar level\u2014can actually be a better means to achieve this goal and can challenge you in different and productive ways. Of course, it works when a pre\u2013formed group is compatible, but I believe that the overall pre\u2013forming process often results in several unbalanced groups with players of different levels, resulting in a worse 189 experience for people in these unbalanced groups. I've also seen a fair amount of politicking with the pre\u2013forming process e.g. people trying to \u201clock in\u201d players early, or abandoning one group for a better one mid\u2013process, which can get messy. I think the staff have a good idea of which players are similar in ability and compatible with others and will ultimately create more balanced groups, resulting in a better overall 189 experience for everyone. The counter of course is that this assumes the staff know better than the students which musicians will be more compatible with each other, which might be difficult in a 10\u2013minute audition. BUT, at least they get to hear everyone directly and assess musical levels side\u2013by\u2013side and for me, that puts them in a better position than students to create balanced, compatible ensembles. Also, stepping back a bit, I don't think the policy is unreasonable\u2014at chamber music festivals the norm is for the organizers\/coaches to assign the groups, and in the industry groups are often pieced together last\u2013minute and musicians often have no say in who they play with.Aside from this digression, this is a brilliant course that any classical musician at Harvard should consider taking! The Parker Quartet is amazing and the course is a huge value\u2013add for the overall music environment and music community at Harvard.","best_comment_short":"So ultimately whether this class is a 5th class gem or a pretty substantial class in itself really depends on how serious your group is about sounding good and rehearsing a lot (and note how much your group cares could change DURING the semester).","best_comment_first":"This class is a great way to continue being involved with music at Harvard with peers who probably also did music at a high level before Harvard.","course_id":"153042","link":"https:\/\/harvard.bluera.com\/harvard\/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=398acb75a449c0a422edc0d1accd8bb61c139e5735d3bf1db7e597c8b5618811c2e922845fa4d97d570d5c34ab49d923&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"},{"course_code":"COMPSCI 1960","course_title_2026":"Designing K\u201312 Computer Science Learning Experiences","course_score_mean":4.9,"rec_score_mean":4.9,"gem_probability_mean":0.0,"sentiment_score_median":0.9414,"best_gem_comment":"","workload_score_mean":5.33,"best_gem_comment_short":"","best_comment":"AMAZING COURSE!

You learn the basic fundamentals of cinematography, sound, editing, and color correction while also learning how to best execute the story you want to tell.

The last thing I\u2019ll say is Tala brings incredible directors and producers as guests to speak with the class.

As a fundamentals\/beginners class, you don't need any prior art experience or even need to know how to draw. This class is all about learning from scratch in all sorts of different mediums. Some of them are:\u2013 2D animation (drawn)\u2013 sand\u2013 clay\u2013 puppets\u2013 paper on layered glass (very cool)\u2013 stop motionJust so so cool. Every week there are exercises (not assignments, and as far as I could tell, not graded) where you learn a new medium. So one class will be dedicated to learned how to use Adobe After Effects, and the exercise that week will be to create a short (maybe 30 second?) long video with some of the stuff you learned. You're not graded on how good the thing you made is, just the fact that you learned how to use anything at all. It's literally the perfect environment for learning because you're encouraged to just mess around.The second\u2013ish half (or maybe last third? time has all muddled up for me now) of the semester is dedicated to the final project. So the first half is working on a specific new tool each week and the second one is mostly self\u2013work. After each week you will have ended up learning a bunch of new techniques and you'll have so many new tools at your disposal, that you can start pitching and idea for a final project. Some people made films that were 2\u20133 minutes long, and others under a minute. Every single student, with or without prior art experience, made amazing works and I'm so glad to have been able to see them all (and see them being made!)There are weekly screenings every Friday from 12pm\u20132pm (unless the schedule changes, but it's roughly 2 hours) where we watch a bunch of short animations. Just so so cool. If you can't go, you can make it up by watching them on your own time and submitting your thoughts on each one, but I can't recommend enough to show up in person because 1. you won't have to write anything, and 2. the in\u2013person discussions are just so great.Lastly, the 4\u2013hour long class can seem daunting, but it really does fly by. We take breaks half\u2013way through (I use mine to get lunch lol) and plus it's not 4 hours of intense work, you're mostly sitting around comfortably working on your animation or messing around with puppets or clay.I've learned so much from this class from specific skills to how animation works as a process in general. I feel so much more prepared to animate more in the future, and will be taking the intermediate class too next semester!Ruth is AMAZING, and so is Michael!! They are so kind, patient and knowledgeable and it was just an honor to have been able to learn so much from them. I had a hard time with my final project because I'm a perfectionist, completely overestimated how much I could get done in the time I had AND started way too late (horrible combo), but Ruth and Michael helped me so much throughout the process. They really guided me on how to make my animation better, what to cut, and just generally how to go about it. I seriously cannot recommend enough that you take this class.

Prof. Mandic and Achraf are the most involved educators I met here at Harvard both in the classroom and beyond, through  the programs they organize or the opportunities they promote to students in section. The Refugee Fieldwork Program offers a possibility for students to deepen the knowledge accumulated in this course while serving communities in need for it over the summer. Only a human who cares deeply about both the topic, not just as something he teaches, but as a part of society he lives to shine light upon would be so invested to create an opportunity like this at Harvard for undergraduates. I cannot imagine a class more worth taking here than this one. You will learn so much about various aspects of forced migration and gain a deep understanding of how different asylum systems work. You will begin to see the issues surrounding forced migration from multiple perspectives and be encouraged to think about feasible solutions to address them. The assignments are super fun and engaging, and quite flexible in the way that you can research deeper the topic in the class that you are most intrigued by, while also being held to the academic standards of how Achraf would call it, \"the next big thing\".

She is truly the best at cultivating conversations that not only bring the readings to life while also pushing your critical thinking skills.Discussions were genuinely rigorous, readings were always relevant and illuminating, and the final project was a fulfilling challenge to actually put our seminar discussions into practice our discussions by having to think critically in an applied way (since the final projects were shared with the Arboretum to be implemented). If you want to be challenged in a new way as a history concentrator by being pushed to think creatively and practically (I would not recommend this to freshman\/sophomores or anyone not already familiar with history), then absolutely take this course. Prof. Miles is one of the few professors on this campus who really cares for you as a person. Yes, she brings snacks to class (which is genuinely a gesture to be grateful for), but she also wants you to come to know yourself more through this course \u2013 the course challenged me to think critically about my own morals and future as a historian, because of Prof. Miles's genuine care for how history does, can, and should exist for the public. There were a few times when she asked us at the start of class to reflect about what we want to contribute to the world, and it honestly makes me emotional to remember. It's easy to lose sight of why you're studying at Harvard, but Prof. Miles will not let you forget it. This class shifted the way I think as a historian, but it was also was philosophical in a way that was fulfilling for me beyond being a historian.

I think around half of the people in 149 this semester did not take 139. However, I would strongly recommend taking 139 as well if you plan to take this course, as it really does not make conceptual sense to learn basically every type of generalized linear model except for a standard linear regression with normally\u2013distributed errors (which is the focus of 139). This course will also be far more satisfying having completed 139 and you will be able to more clearly see why we are doing certain things. Some topics are also retaught from scratch from 139, so you'll be slightly ahead having completed that before this course.Content: The course covers different generalized linear models (e.g. logistic regression, Poisson regression, multinomial regression) as well as some extensions beyond these models, including some more ML\u2013related topics (smoothers, GAMs, decision trees) and related non\u2013GLMs (negative binomial, beta\u2013binomial, proportional odds). The theoretical basis for this class is rooted in exponential dispersion families (essentially NEFs if you remember those from 111), and their log\u2013likelihoods\/MLEs. We touch on topics such as model selection, diagnostics, and missing data methods as well.Course structure: Mark is a great professor and is very well\u2013organized. Lecture notes are well\u2013written and contain basically everything you need to complete the homeworks and do well on exams. If you don't want to attend a 9 AM lecture twice a week, the lecture notes (or the Panopto recording) are entirely sufficient. In fact, you can complete nearly everything on the homework assignments solely with the lecture notes (and associated R script provided on Canvas). Lecture notes and homeworks will be posted far in advance in contrast to some other stats courses where homeworks are released late or not at all. There are office hours and sections provided, though sections were sparsely attended since the lecture notes are so well\u2013written and self\u2013contained, and since the course enrollment was relatively small. If you come to lecture or watch the recordings, you will probably not need to go to section.Homeworks: There are 6 regular homework assignments throughout the semester, due roughly every other week on Monday. As I mentioned, they can be completed basically with just the lecture notes. They are mostly applied and in R, though there will occasionally be more theoretical questions. However, these assignments are very straightforward and should not require that much stress or time. Mark guides you through the applied problems and so you'll almost never have to look up an obscure command to do something. These assignments should take no more than 2 or 3 hours if you're referring to the lecture notes for guidance.Mini\u2013projects: In addition to the 6 regular homeworks, there are also 3 \"mini\u2013projects\" which are really just additional psets, but the mini\u2013projects have you explore one dataset 3 times throughout the second half of the semester to implement tools as we learn them in class. So in reality this class has 9 homework assignments, but these mini\u2013projects are slightly shorter than regular homeworks and usually due in the weeks in between the due dates of two homeworks. They also only start in the second half of the class, following spring break and the first midterm.Exams: This class has 2 exams: a midterm and a final. However, it's more accurate to describe them as Midterm 1 and Midterm 2, as they are both the same length (75 minutes). Midterm 2 is notably not cumulative which is why it is still only 75 minutes long (though still held during finals period), though in reality you learn so many more things in the second half of the class that it not being cumulative doesn't really change anything, and you will still need to have a strong understanding of many of the concepts from the first half anyway. The exams are not really that tricky and mostly test interpretation of model outputs and related concepts. There are some theoretical concepts covered on exams, though no more so than computing a log likelihood or an MLE. However, there are some more obscure formulas required to complete certain parts that are not provided to you, so it's a good thing that you're allowed to bring in a cheat sheet for the exams. Make sure that you make a good cheat sheet or you may lose out on a large number of points because you didn't have the right formula written down on your cheat sheet (i.e. Newton\u2013Raphson or an F test statistic). Exam averages hovered around 70 percent, not too much different from 110\/111, though the exams in this class were definitely far easier and more predictable than those. If you take the practice exams, review the lecture notes, and make a good cheat sheet, you should be fine.Grade distribution: About half the class gets a final grade in the A range, and about half in the B range. But again, if you put in a decent level of effort and stay on top of the class, you should be able to get an A range grade. Mark is very fair in how he determines and curves grades, so it is really only if you are unable or unwilling to dedicate enough time and effort to the class (which is again, far less than 110\/111) that you would do worse than you'd have liked to.Overall workload: I rarely spent more than 2 or 3 hours each week outside of class on 149. Homework assignments were very straightforward and could be quickly completed using the lecture notes. This workload increased the weeks of the two exams, though you probably don't need to do much more than review the lecture notes and homeworks, make your cheat sheet, and complete the practice exams.Now that I've summarized the class, I'll address whether one should take it over 139 or 244.139  vs 149: 149 is essentially an extension of 139 and allows for far more flexibility in modeling than what 139 does with OLS regression. That being said, 149 can reasonably be taken without any knowledge from 139 and is actually an easier\/less time consuming class than 139 (you can verify this by comparing Q guides). So if you just want to get this modeling requirement out of the way and maybe if you have a very busy fall schedule, 149 may be preferable. But if you want to have a complete, widely\u2013applicable knowledge base of understanding, you'd be best off taking both 139 and 149. While there are some redundancies between the two, taking both gives you basically everything you need to statistically model basically anything. Another little\u2013discussed note of importance is that 149 is approved as an Econ elective (as of Spring 2025) while 139 is not, which may be of interest to Stat\u2013Econ double concentrators.149 vs 244: 149 is a very applied class and does not get too much into the weeds of the more theoretical concepts. It is mainly focused on interpreting results and choosing the appropriate model. While this means 149 is very applicable, if you're more theory\u2013oriented you may want to take 244 instead, which combines 139 and 149 into one graduate\u2013level class heavy in linear algebra, calculus, and proofs. It also meets the modeling requirement, but does not cover all of the application discussed in 139 and 149. So I'd recommend 244 only if you're more interested in the theory (and perhaps going for advanced course track honors\/concurrent masters). Though you can of course take 139\/149 and then take 244 as well if you'd like, which is what I plan to do.Overall, you should consider taking 149 if you want a low\u2013stress yet extremely useful class where you'll learn a lot without having the class feel like a burden on your schedule.","best_comment_short":"This course will also be far more satisfying having completed 139 and you will be able to more clearly see why we are doing certain things.","best_comment_first":"STAT 149 is a very well\u2013organized and straightforward class that I would recommend to any stat concentrator or secondary.","course_id":"118974","link":"https:\/\/harvard.bluera.com\/harvard\/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=fe902391eecc22ac6c7da0a4203ad1ab0445cafb471e092ddc6d6579af72db75f79df40c90cf73d6b237bca37a2ef995&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"},{"course_code":"GOV 51","course_title_2026":"Data Analysis and Politics","course_score_mean":4.54,"rec_score_mean":4.31,"gem_probability_mean":0.0,"sentiment_score_median":0.8953,"best_gem_comment":"","workload_score_mean":8.0,"best_gem_comment_short":"","best_comment":"The first few weeks may feel overwhelming, but it really gets better.

Kudos to them for being very open minded about it and really wanting students to give their feedback. They adjusted PSET length mid\u2013semester which was very fair and they were all overall very open to suggestions even within the course's syllabus. Overall, great teaching coming from Ryan, Hisham, and Jaime.Grading scheme: Loved that there were no exams, making the class very enjoyable and light. Especially if you want to explore something so nuanced and difficult like natural products, not having exams was great. The part about graded on effort I thought was a bit inconsistent with some of the grades I had friends getting given we did the PSETs together and put in the same effort. I think you have to be very clear if it is graded on effort or correctness and if its by effort, have very good feedback so that student understands they got the point for doing the question but have room to understand where they can grow. Also grading highly varied among CAs which is always difficult to understand and unfair, so finding a way to make that more standard is essential, especially if taking the effort\u2013based route because then it just doesn't make sense if the same effort was placed on all PSETs that they wouldn't receive the similar grades.PSETs: The exposure to Pymol and Alphafold is super fun and those PSETs were very enjoyable, whereas the others just seemed very long and tedious. I feel like there are better ways of engaging with the course content than those 10 page PSETS. They did slowly change this up during the semester and condensed into more thought out questions which was great (perhaps just not the last PSET that had 20 pages and most people just dropped it especially because of final project presentations and other finals). I honestly think having more Pymol and Alphafold PSETs would've been a super enjoyable route and very rewarding too building those skills nowadays. Lectures: They leaned much more towards chemistry than bio which would make sense given it says pharmacy in the name of the course but I expected a perhaps more higher overview of the content on the chem side. A focus on understanding why certain plants are explored, their compound effect on the body, classes of plants to explore, etc was what I expected vs learning about terpenoids etc. I think these kinda do walk hand\u2013in\u2013hand so I'd just add that Chem27 is also a pre\u2013req for the class because then the chem part isn't overwhelming and taking away from the experience, despite not having Chem27 hindering my experience completely.  Some of the first PSETs had questions more focused on the chemistry side that which is what we learned in Chem27 4 weeks later or something.Final Project: Super enjoyable putting into practice everything you learned in class and analyzing something of your choice. Highly recommend taking their early deadlines seriously and really planning out what you want to talk about vs last minute cramming because this is meant to be enjoyable and you understanding how your favorite natural product's mechanism and its 3D structure.","best_comment_short":"I honestly think having more Pymol and Alphafold PSETs would've been a super enjoyable route and very rewarding too building those skills nowadays.","best_comment_first":"All the feedback being given must be taken with a grain of salt because the TFs and CAs were very aware all throughout of the semester of how much our feedback as first time class takers would influence the course's overall structure.","course_id":"225811","link":"https:\/\/harvard.bluera.com\/harvard\/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=14807ae0fd8a734ea466d171e8a687d96c33c65f64238e866a2138b7aa41cc8b336898de88230b77e8f26b3bcd2c9432&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"},{"course_code":"COMPLIT 290","course_title_2026":"Migration and the Humanities","course_score_mean":4.5,"rec_score_mean":4.42,"gem_probability_mean":0.0,"sentiment_score_median":0.743,"best_gem_comment":"","workload_score_mean":6.44,"best_gem_comment_short":"","best_comment":"This class is incredible.

So here are my thoughts (mostly for undergrads, PhDs are welcome to skip this essay as you are forced to take this class):My preparation: I am a junior who took Math 25A\/B, Stat 210, and 211. I had not taken Stat 212 or any other math course before taking 213. I don\u2019t think a deep understanding of measure theory is really needed for this course, but I\u2019m sure it helps if you have one.Material: 4.6\/5. The material is very foundational and if you are very interested in statistics (which you probably are given you are reading the 213 Qguide in the first place), you will love it. The course is broadly divided into three parts: estimation (the longest one comprising most of the semester), hypothesis test, and Bayesian inference (which lasts for about a week).Starting with estimation, the first few weeks on the unit can be rather dry. In the words of Pragya herself, she doesn\u2019t exactly like the material in these weeks due to them feeling more analysis\u2013y than statistics\u2013y and I completely agree; the number of assumptions in some theorems is so large that they become a pain to check through whenever you are working on homework. I don\u2019t think these weeks were bad by any means, but they were definitely not the best either.These problems mostly end by the time we discuss QMD, which may seem like the bashiest, why\u2013does\u2013this\u2013exist definition when you first learn them, but you will quickly learn how useful they are for the rest of the semester; it\u2019s actually astonishing how much QMD gets used as the most important assumption in so many theorems despite how ugly the definition is. So the estimation unit is basically divided into two halves: the first half which is dry and the second half which utilizes QMD. So if you have hatred for analysis, you may not like the course at the beginning, but I do promise that it will get better as it goes on.For the hypothesis test unit, Pragya does a great job at explaining why we should test the asymptotic power of different hypothesis testing methods using an alternative that gets harder and harder as the sample size increases. The motivation is great, and using LeCam\u2019s Third Lemma to get results for this is pretty satisfying. The one issue I had however is that we don\u2019t exactly derive many ways to get the asymptotic power under the alternatives in class nor in the notes. For example, for the Likelihood\u2013Ratio Test, we learned about the asymptotic distribution of the test statistic under the null, but we didn\u2019t really discuss what happens under a sequence of alternatives except in the problem set where we did it only for the Gaussian case. It would have been helpful to better integrate the measure theory that came before this because as it stands, it doesn\u2019t feel like I learned that much about how to find the power under sequences of alternatives. Nonetheless, a great unit; also extending the idea of a most powerful test to an asymptotically most powerful test was very interesting.Finally, for the Bayesian unit: It needs to be longer. One week of Bayesian statistics that virtually only aims to prove the Bernstein\u2013von\u2013Mises Theorem really doesn\u2019t provide much at all for Bayesian statistics. I do get that this is supposed to be a foundational course and statistics began mostly from a frequentist perspective, but I definitely think that as a class that is supposed to prepare PhDs for research, it should give a wider view of Bayesian inference. This may be difficult to do since the material is pretty packed already, but I definitely think that the estimation unit was too long and some parts of it (example: perhaps proof of asymptotic normality of MLE? It is an important result but the proof was long and felt unmotivated for the most part.) can be cut to give some more room for Bayesian stuff. I enjoyed what existed of Bayesian inference in the course nevertheless.Lectures: 4.8\/5. Pragya is a great lecturer and makes it incredibly obvious that she knows what she is talking about. She also occasionally makes jokes that integrate into what she was talking about perfectly, which gives the lectures a little spark that I\u2019ve only seen Pragya be able to accomplish. The only complaint I have is that the lectures can be a bit dry sometimes (especially in the estimation unit), but this mostly just occurs on topics that are dry in the first place.Problem Sets: 4.3\/5. There are biweekly problem sets, and there are 5 total with one drop. Let me make this clear: Unless you are more of a math major than a statistics major (even then I feel this may apply), Stat 213 is NOT easier than Stat 211. The problem sets are less of \u201cfind the one hard\u2013to\u2013see trick\u201d that Stat 211 often employed. The difficulty of Stat 213 homework comes from the difficulty of the material itself (not to say Stat 211 had easy material, but it was definitely easier than 213). Stat 213 material is packed and we don\u2019t go over applications to all of the theorems; these applications are moved to the problem sets, and this can make the homework very difficult. This isn\u2019t really problematic, but just something you should be aware of going into this course. As for grading, I would sometimes lose points for \u201cformality,\u201d but I\u2019m not sure exactly where the formality points lie as they can be very subjective and the staff solutions can seem short and less formal as well. Another thing to be aware of.One thing I should mention though: I utterly failed to befriend PhD students in this class, so I basically worked on the problem sets alone. I\u2019m sure the homework is a lot easier if you are less introverted than me and actually get to know some PhD students lol.However, one big problem that makes my opinion of problem sets be lower than it deserves: The first two problems in the fourth assignment were in the section notes. I didn\u2019t realize this, so I basically had to solve this from scratch. This leads to two outcomes, both of which are problematic: 1. Someone who didn\u2019t read the section notes tries to solve the problem. Then they are disadvantaged by those who did read it. 2. Someone who did read the section notes copies the solution. Then they are disadvantaged by the fact they didn\u2019t really learn from the problem. Either way, this is a problem; I strongly believe that no problem presented in section should be on the homework. These two problems weren\u2019t exactly the hardest problems in problem sets so it isn\u2019t as bad as it could have been, but something to keep in mind for the course heading forward.My advice for undergrads: TL;DR: If you are in the following set, I would recommend taking the course:{Took analysis} \\cap (({Interested in stats} \\cap {Took measure theory}) \\cup {REALLY interested in stats}) \\cap {Have time for this course}. I was in the {REALLY interested in stats} set and not in the {Took measure theory} set (which made it more challenging for me), and I have no regrets about taking this course. It\u2019s very foundational and the material is legitimately interesting. I still love the way sequences of more difficult alternative hypotheses were presented as well as how much QMD can be used for good results. If you really love statistics, I can\u2019t see yourself not enjoying this course. So unless you think this course will be too much of a hassle with your schedule, take it! I would also recommend taking it your sophomore\/junior year as it can be difficult to manage this your senior year especially if you want to write a thesis. But definitely have a Plan B in case you find this class to be overwhelming.And be warned: There are 24 hour take\u2013home midterm and final, and those are brutal.That concludes my essay. Hopefully any undergrads reading this found it helpful.For Pragya: Thank you for a great semester!

Girma is a very accessible instructor whom you can ask any question without fear of judgment, and it was always a pleasure to attend his office hours during which I gained a lot of physical insight. The subject\u2013matter of the course \u2014 electrodynamics \u2014 is an extremely beautiful subject, and knowledge and mastery thereof is crucial to any budding theoretical physicist. Unfortunately, we did not cover the entirety of Griffiths in sufficient depth due to temporal constraints \u2014 which is a shame \u2014 but in future renditions of the course, this can be easily remedied by adding a third lecture every week. In terms of prior background and preparation, 153 is a self\u2013contained course that builds up the theory of classical electrodynamics from scratch, so you really do not need a ton of prior knowledge in EM (contrary to what the course prerequisites might say). That being said, such knowledge is useful insofar as it makes the fast pace of 153 more manageable. Personally, I came into the class with only AP Physics C and physics 19 under my belt and did just fine (incidentally, this just goes to show that physics 16 really is unnecessary for more advanced courses like 153). If you're considering taking 153, my suggestion would be to study chapter 1 of Griffiths over winter break if you have never seen multi\u2013variable calculus before. If you have time, you should also take a look at chapters 2 and 3 just so that you don't get lost in the first few weeks. To end this QGuide, I'd like to give some advice on how to get the most out of 153 during the semester. Besides going to all the lectures, I strongly recommend that you read Griffiths (by read, I mean read it religiously). Due to lack of time, I did not read Griffiths in its entirety, which in hindsight I regret given the phenomenal amount of physical insight that this book contains. I think the best strategy is to read Girma's lecture notes before coming to lecture to get a brief overview of the material that will be covered (otherwise, you will easily get lost, because oftentimes Girma skips a lot of the mathematical steps and refers you to the lecture notes), and then after lecture you can read the corresponding sections\/chapters in Griffiths to solidify your understanding. I cannot stress the importance of doing this, because with the take\u2013home format of the exams, it is very easy to get away with fragmented understanding of the material, whereas what you should be aiming for is a robust grasp on electrodynamics. TL;DR: Fantastic course, beautiful material, wonderful instructor. Not a lot of background is required. Just read the first chapter(s) of Griffiths over winter break, and make an effort to read the textbook throughout the semester to get the most out of this course.","best_comment_short":"TL;DR: Fantastic course, beautiful material, wonderful instructor.","best_comment_first":"Physics 153 with Girma is an incredible experience.","course_id":"111822","link":"https:\/\/harvard.bluera.com\/harvard\/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=08441061125b6df412693117a9e0ffab3c91184b7b1d0b7d847e733302bb27408effd9c2012b3c9253c0870cdfdc05e9&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"},{"course_code":"CHEM 171","course_title_2026":"Biological Synthesis","course_score_mean":4.33,"rec_score_mean":4.3,"gem_probability_mean":0.0,"sentiment_score_median":0.9337,"best_gem_comment":"","workload_score_mean":8.67,"best_gem_comment_short":"","best_comment":"Chem 171 is a great class overall, but it does have its quirks.
