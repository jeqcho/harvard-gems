The weekly assignments and readings aren't too long but to get the most out of the course you should do them. The major project of the course is a 10 page paper on an object you pick (that will be going into an exhibit \u2013 our kunstkamer objects go on display in July 2025, more on that later) and it's super interesting.On the objects, this was mainly about Dutch 16\u201317th century art. Since our collection is going up I'm not sure what the focus will be but it's worth reaching out and asking because if you aren't at all interested in the theme you won't get as much out of the course as someone who is \u2013 like we all became experts on Dutch 16\u201317th century art.

If you're only kind of interested like I was\/am, you'll have a good time, but things can get a little boring. The class is VERY formulaic week to week: you read a few texts, Seth explains them in lecture, and you discuss them in section. There is very little throughout the semester to break up this routine, which can make the whole course just blend into one big blob of philosophy. That being said, I still give this class a very positive review. Seth is very intentional with what\/how he teaches, and it's obvious that one of his goals is for each of his students to leave his class as better people. He's also just a cool dude, and makes the whole class a super chill vibe. I also really like how major assignments are structured. You have to write two ~1500 word essays which are based more on your own thinking and perspective than a standard research paper. They were overall really enjoyable to write, and the grading is pretty friendly if you do a good job. Great class! If you're looking for a fun elective which is easy, but not a joke, and you want to learn something along the way, this is an excellent choice.","best_comment_short":"They were overall really enjoyable to write, and the grading is pretty friendly if you do a good job.","best_comment_first":"If you're really into moral\/ethical philosophy, I think you will absolutely love this class.","course_id":"141608","link":"https:\/\/harvard.bluera.com\/harvard\/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=36e3f5b46deffd4939a9fa73838c78edf36c27a046fd706eeaec6154c3569a885e87feb5ac76a3461912a5f7c8df784b&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"},{"course_code":"ESPP 160","course_title_2026":"US Environmental Policy and Policymaking: The Role of Congress, EPA, Stakeholders, and Courts","course_score_mean":4.52,"rec_score_mean":4.52,"gem_probability_mean":0.0,"sentiment_score_median":0.9366,"best_gem_comment":"","workload_score_mean":3.93,"best_gem_comment_short":"","best_comment":"I HIGHLY recommend this course to anyone who has any interest in government structures, climate mitigation\/adaptation,  and the environment. Professor Jenks, though very thorough in communicating the various obstacles and challenges of environmental + public health protection, maintains an optimistic, forward\u2013thinking outlook that's incredibly refreshing compared to the doom and gloom that sometimes pervades environmental science courses.  The once\u2013a\u2013week section allows you to engage deeply with the material and spend more time thinking about issues and solutions rather than completing assignments as a means to an end.  Additionally, the different perspectives of weekly guest speakers offer a view into the practical applications of everything you learn about. The assignments are challenging, but feedback is very helpful and grading is fair. I walk away from this course not only feeling more confident about my ability to engage with big questions and complex solutions but also more prepared to engage with challenging source materials and write policy memorandums. Take this course if you want to grow in your understanding, to grow as a writer, and to grow as an aspiring agent of change!","best_comment_short":"I walk away from this course not only feeling more confident about my ability to engage with big questions and complex solutions but also more prepared to engage with challenging source materials and write policy memorandums.","best_comment_first":"I HIGHLY recommend this course to anyone who has any interest in government structures, climate mitigation\/adaptation,  and the environment.","course_id":"224030","link":"https:\/\/harvard.bluera.com\/harvard\/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=620cc76985531b481da77ac654b624cec554631c14ee01b4b621c4f745da34608bcf11e87fd6b9521525e81eee4b14ae&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"},{"course_code":"RSRA 298B","course_title_2026":"Master's Thesis Reading and Research","course_score_mean":5.0,"rec_score_mean":5.0,"gem_probability_mean":0.0,"sentiment_score_median":0.0,"best_gem_comment":"","workload_score_mean":4.0,"best_gem_comment_short":"","best_comment":"","best_comment_short":"","best_comment_first":"","course_id":"160540","link":"https:\/\/harvard.bluera.com\/harvard\/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=fdb305e3e3f85be59fa1dadc79580253fee4a221e22fa049a3a0119ea86c5646afbc7506c5e7b148baa5accaa6bf1bd9&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"},{"course_code":"CHEM 165","course_title_2026":"Experimental Physical Chemistry","course_score_mean":4.91,"rec_score_mean":5.0,"gem_probability_mean":0.0,"sentiment_score_median":0.95635,"best_gem_comment":"","workload_score_mean":4.0,"best_gem_comment_short":"","best_comment":"Khaled is an absolutely wonderful instructor who cares an incredible amount about the students in the class and is willing to help them in whatever way possible \u2013 I cannot emphasize how much I appreciate the help that he gave me over the duration of the final project!
