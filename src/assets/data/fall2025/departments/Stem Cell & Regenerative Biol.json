Ya\u2013chieh is an absolute gem of a professor, and her engaging lectures and passion and enthusiasm for the material are so apparent in every class. The class balances lecture material with literature review\/journal club super well, and I've really enjoyed discussing different papers in the stem cell biology field and even participating in debates with my classmates. Sally and Kiwi are super responsive and are so helpful. I cannot say enough great things about SCRB 145 and would recommend to all who are interested in the topic!","workload_score_mean":3.63,"best_gem_comment_short":"Ya\u2013chieh is an absolute gem of a professor, and her engaging lectures and passion and enthusiasm for the material are so apparent in every class.","course_id":"161207","link":"https:\/\/harvard.bluera.com\/harvard\/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=7a608ca50f9160a5ba62e98df3c84953e9dad2d8216f423e3ab8e92f39d149f084a12c02e9a844bc08f5a8d0daf8adfc&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"}]
