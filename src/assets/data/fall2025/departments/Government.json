I felt like I did gain \"A New Perspective\" on American government, true to its name. I also felt like I have a much better understanding of how the government functions. If you are interested in government, I would even classify it as a gem. You are able to get by with watching videos of homework, and it is very straightforward to study for. You still have to do things, but it was overall pretty easy.","workload_score_mean":6.23,"best_gem_comment_short":"If you are interested in government, I would even classify it as a gem.","course_id":"111813","link":"https:\/\/harvard.bluera.com\/harvard\/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=8b72be750edb477062b354047a908649e9d836f25690fe0bd78d8bbff53a377c143fc8ce0668aecc446c477c02461883&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"}]
