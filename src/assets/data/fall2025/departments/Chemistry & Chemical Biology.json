In terms of preparation I was a little scared because I hadn't taken physics or linear algebra but all you really need is a good grasp on basic calculus (you dont' really need linear algebra) and some physics (but not really, I took it at the same time as I took PS2) and it should be fine. The psets are not too hard and you only need to finish them every two weeks. The presentation was also not too bad, you just have to prepare it according to the rubric and that was it. The teaching staff is veryyy nice in helping with assignments so def go to OH. Prepare for the final, or at least prepare for it to be very long. It took me like 15+ hours but I think that was abnormal for this year","workload_score_mean":5.78,"best_gem_comment_short":"This is a gem but you should still try to keep up with the material just because of how interesting it is.","course_id":"112976","link":"https:\/\/harvard.bluera.com\/harvard\/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=3ce6be190ec7a6e1f7f625cf596ed9960fce44540c1c32e8306bbbad85676e08aabd68991fa1a4885dfa096e687fa337&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"}]
