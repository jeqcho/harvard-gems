Erin and Sophie are amazing. it is hard to get into, a lot of people fill out the form to get in, but go for it. There is one final project which is totally manageable, and one or two readings every week. You get to know your classmates so well because the class is so small and hand selected in a cool way. every class is basically a discussion of the readings (basically everyone does different ones and then you all talk about it).","workload_score_mean":4.11,"best_gem_comment_short":"TAKE THIS CLASS, a true gem.","course_id":"220650","link":"https:\/\/harvard.bluera.com\/harvard\/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=ffc6730b8e151e993722e990466e9bd0e9da034d310c6f0cc1ecf18280b6f6b8a3562119fa8c8beb056a1e9b3b7c6040&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"},{"course_code":"HEB 140","course_title_2025":"The Evolution of Friendship","course_score_mean":3.27,"rec_score_mean":3.31,"gem_probability_mean":0.03125,"sentiment_score_median":0.8953,"best_gem_comment":"","workload_score_mean":4.21,"best_gem_comment_short":"","course_id":"222906","link":"https:\/\/harvard.bluera.com\/harvard\/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=6bd303cace9ced34e8cc7725acf80b4e550209f78bfd4a6b487303501f7e496740f8ae1332a6f256c32d5c39d4a8ccfb&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"}]
