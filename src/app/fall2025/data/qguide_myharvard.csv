How do destination images condition our perceptions of native people, public space and collective memory? This seminar explores tourism beyond its facile association with leisure to consider its implications for development, environmental protection, heritage conservation, and the commodification of history. Treating tourism as an enterprise that trades in everything from sensory fantasies to cheap cosmetic surgeries and pictures of tropical paradise, this course contemplates the role of the imaginary in the political and the political in the imaginary. Through careful analysis of travel journals, audiovisual material and first hand accounts from culture brokers and travelers alike, we’ll explore the industry’s colonial past in relation to Black, Indigenous and queer people’s efforts to bend tourism towards a more libratory future. While geographically situated in Latin America and the Caribbean, the course draws from comparative contexts in continental Africa and the United States to critically analyze tourism in relation to colonialism, the plantation economy, African diasporic kinship and the afterlives of slavery. Readings include classic texts such as Jamaica Kincaid’s (1988) A Small Place, Kamala Kempadoo’s Sun, Sex and Gold (1999) Paulla Ebron’s Performing Africa (2002), Mimi Sheller´s Consuming the Caribbean (2003) and Saidiya Hartman’s Loose Your Mother (2008). These works will be paired with Florence Babb’s The Tourism Encounter (2010) Jemima Pierre’s Predicament of Blackness (2009) Krista Thompson’s An Eye for the Tropics (2016), and recent ethnographies such as Christen Smith’s Afro-Paradise (2016), Megan Rivers-Moore’s Gringo Gluch (2016) Patricia Pinho’s Mapping Diaspora (2018), Bianca Williams’s The Pursuit of Happiness (2018), Corinna Campbell’s The Cultural Work (2020), and Anadelia A.

I recommend this course with great enthusiasm to anyone interested. I was uncertain that I would take this course given my commitments and the q–guide reports stating how challenging the material was, however, I am so grateful that I chose to enroll. My background was CS50, CS20, Math 21a, AM 22a, AM50, and Stat 110. I also had experience with Pandas, Jupyter Notebook, and predictive modeling in Python (AM50). The true prerequisites ought to be CS50 or CS32 and Math 21a. Having predictive modeling (in Python), linear algebra, and probability knowledge is most certainly helpful but unnecessary to having an amazing CS1090a experience. Advantages of CS109a:0. The professors are incredible. Pavlos is a sight for sore (and heavy) eyes at 9am. Pavlos is the funniest and most engaging CS professor I have had, and he takes time to get to know each of his students. He cares for your learning, making it a truly special learning environment. Natesh is incredible in his ability to inspire students about the importance and use cases of the material. He also deeply cares about students' learning as he spends a portion of lecture time gauging students' understanding of the material.  1. The TFs are incredible. Chris and Elaine are the most supportive TF I have had at Harvard. It felt like they were always available to help with any problem or issue, whether at their OH or on Ed. 2. On that note there is incredible support. The course has multiple office hours every week, held virtually and all across campus. The Ed discussion is always active and TFs reply fairly quickly. There are some cases of egregious amount of waiting time for a response, that is usually towards the end of the semester. The amount of support gives a great opportunity to succeed in the course.3. The material itself is an incredible introduction to Data Science and machine learning. The material covered is widely applicable to other STEM topics. I noticed a significant overlap in Math 21a, AM115, and AM121 material. Additionally, there is optional extra work available on Ed which allows one to dive into greater detail into Data Science or other programming concepts. 4. Bi–weekly partner psets are so clutch. There is also a generous late day policy. Need I say more?5. The course organization is superb. Everything you need is on Ed. Except the class recordings, those are on Canvas. Things to take into account before enrolling:0. The psets are time–consuming. Whilst true in that they get easier as the semester goes on, they are still a significant time commitment. I usually took anywhere between 10–20 hours to complete a pset, and I completed all except one pset on my own. Remember, the psets are bi–weekly. So this meant spending around 1 hour or 1.5 hours a day on the pset. Procrastinating on psets in this course can be awful and cause one to fall behind. Also, some of the psets are frustrating, in that the material covered in the pset is useless to other concepts in the class (HW1web scraping) or they are incredibly vague whilst still being heavily penalized (like HW5).1. The course is fast–paced for sure. Understanding the topics completely is a demanding task, and one where one must spend significant time dedicated to the material. The content is usually iterative, so to understand future concepts, one must understand the previous concepts! I took CS109a with another relatively intense math course, and two relatively easier courses, so I was able to spend this needed time on the material. I never took a break from this class. Honestly, everyday I was doing something related to the course, whether working on my pset, going over class notes, or rewatching a lecture. The time commitment only grows as the semester goes on. Sure, the psets may get a little easier but the project demands get harder. The content also gets more challenging. The end of the semester during Thanksgiving break and after is like all cylinders firing, with the lectures/project/exam/final psets. So, really, there is no break from CS109a.

In the rapidly evolving field of data science, merely creating powerful predictive models is not enough. Efficiently deploying and managing these models in production environments - a practice often referred to as MLOps - has become an essential skill. MLOps bridges the gap between the development of Machine Learning (ML) models and their operation in production settings, combining practices from data science, data engineering and software engineering.

You will most definitely learn a lot, and I've learned things that I think I'll genuinely use for the remainder of my degree and research. Doing the textbook readings was helpful to comprehend the class material, but if you've got a very strong linear algebra background it might not be needed (more on the textbook later). The psets are good, I found quite a few of them enjoyable, and they're all reasonably scoped (taking 3–4 hours each). So if you add the psets with quiz review and readings for the lecture, you're looking at a fairly light workload for the course. Grading is all quick, and you get reasonable feedback for graded assignments. The lectures do a great job blending whiteboard instruction and matlab demonstrations of concepts, so you get the theory and practical application of most of what you learn. We haven't gotten project grades back at the time of writing, but I definitely spent a large portion of time (upwards of 30–40 hours) on the final project, but I'm not sure how that will translate grade wise. The quizzes, if you're reading Heath (if Heath is the textbook) and paying attention in class, you will still fail. I walked out of 2 of the 3 quizzes, content knowing that if I'd studied 10–15 more hours for the quiz and done every practice question in the back of the Heath chapters, I still would've done poorly. With a fairly robust postmortem of the first quiz to see how I could've studied more efficiently I'd come to the conclusion that the only way to stumble upon the information needed to answer the question was random chance googling or GenAI responses (because the material was absent in the textbook and lecture notes). Doing a thorough lit review for my final project, though, I found that Dr Trefethen had his own Numerical Computation textbook, and I was fairly shocked to find that all of the questions I thought were unreasonable on the quizzes were either explicit in his textbook or easily inferred from the information in his textbook. I'm not sure if this was deliberate, or just an extension of ""he thinks these are very important numerical computation concepts, noted by him putting them on the quiz and also in his textbook, but the two events aren't deliberately correlated"". The largest recommendation that I would have is to use his textbook to follow his lectures and prepare for his quizzes. I didn't find Heath particularly effective, and our lectures jumped around Heath so frequently that you'd skip large sections in certain chapters anyways. Our TFs were completely amazing – and I wanted to make sure to give them a shout out here. Elaine and Chuin Wei in particular put in a lot of work to help prepare students for quizzes and help students understand lectures. Chuin Wei's notes were better than mine most of the time, definitely helping prepare as best you could for the quizzes. Grading was incredibly fast (got most assignments back within a week), and generally fair. TFs rocked.",0.9973,"Trefethen is very passionate about the subject matter, and it does show in his teaching. The lectures are good and problem sets are reasonable. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about the exams. There are 3 exams and, in general, they are extremely unreasonable. In a strange way, the exams aren't objectively that hard; they just require you to have exactly the right intuition about everything. Unfortunately, having the right intuition cannot be taught or learnt in one semester. And only Trefethen himself had that intuition, even amongst the teaching staff.  The result is that most people fail the exams, even after generous grading (and partial credit) by Trefethen. The exams feel less like a test of what you have learnt in the class and more a test of just naturally what your raw IQ is. There really is no way to prepare for the tests, either. You can read the textbook cover to cover and know and understand everything in the course perfectly well, but still fail the tests. Overall, I did learn quite a bit in this course. However, I also felt that most of the course content was quite dated, and should not be mandatory for students in the CSE program to learn.",-0.614,"This is a class that is required for the Applied Math masters, but I think that everyone in the computational sciences should take it even if it isn't required!

From someone that took AP50a and will be continuing with AP50b, here are my honest thoughts about the course. As many suggest from previous Q–Reports, AP50a is a course where you will learn literally NOTHING, but walk away with an A as long as you put in the time and effort (although be forewarned, that time is going to be A LOT).For context, the structure of the class includes a LOT of weekly assignments, as listed below:• Sunday by 11:59 PM – Reading Assessment: you are expected to read about 20–30 pages in the textbook and leave about 10–15 comments to ‘stimulate conversation’ with your peers• Sunday by 11:59 PM – Readiness Assurance (Individual): you complete around 10–20 practice questions individually based on the topics you learned from reading• Tuesday by 9 AM – Tutorial (Individual): you complete an application–based assignment on Desmos consisting of about 20–30 slides on the weekly topics you learned from reading• Tuesday IN CLASS – Tutorial (Team): you review over the Desmos tutorial assignment with your team and complete check–ins with the teaching staff + correct your answers – ONLY THIS ROUND IS GRADED• Tuesday by 6 PM – Readiness Assurance (Team Round): you re–visit the Readiness Assurance from Sunday with your team and re–submit what you think is correct – ONLY THIS ROUND IS GRADED• Thursday by 9 AM – Challenge (Individual): you complete a 3 question problem set individually before class and submit to Gradescope• Thursday IN CLASS – Challenge (Team): you review over your challenge with your team and complete check–ins with the teaching staff + correct your answers – ONLY THIS ROUND IS GRADED• Thursday IN CLASS – Skill Session: you take your newly learned concepts from the week and put it into practice by completing different activities + a short Canvas quiz – ONLY THIS ROUND IS GRADEDAs you can see, there are a minimum of at least EIGHT weekly assignments you will have to do in AP50, which combined with the in–class component, means that you are spending around 15 hours/week MINIMUM to complete your objectives. The plus side to this is that AP50a contains NO EXAMS and also only grades your TEAM sessions, which means that only your CORRECTED copy of the Challenge + Tutorial are counted. However, this makes for a very unintuitive and time consuming way of learning, as you have no lectures and only learn based off of a short textbook reading and some random assignments. The truth about AP50a is, if you do all of the tasks outlined above, you are GUARANTEED an A. They do not lie or trick students, and are very straight forward with the requirements. However, just be warned that you MUST stay on track and complete EVERYTHING on time, as even missing ONE assignment or having ONE dissatisfactory grade will automatically bump you down a letter grade. As a result, AP50a is only a good fit for those that are able to stay on top of their work.From a classroom dynamics perspective, AP50 is very interesting. In terms of the teaching team, some of the TFs do not seem adequately prepared and often make odd mistakes. Every Tuesday and Thursday, students do “check in sessions” with the TF where they present their group’s final answers to the Tutorial and/or Challenge and get feedback. However, there have been multiple instances of TFs either being extremely rude and unhelpful, or straight up providing inaccurate and wrong information. This also extends to grading, where they have accidentally docked students for things they cannot even identify later on when asked. This even extends into the actual structure of the class, as there have been multiple instances where there are issues with the Canvas page or associated assignments (as with a huge banner across one of the Tutorials on Demos telling the teaching team to remove a section of the assignment, even though it was still there and had already been published). Unfortunately, this made the class seem very poorly unorganized and like an afterthought in some regards.Now that we’re a semester in, to be honest, I do not think I have learned much from AP50a. Although the course boasts this reputation and *big idea* of using a different teaching approach that is meant to enable students to learn by DOING, the course falls short of this in many ways. At the end of the day, you will basically turn into an automated machine each week with completing each of the assignments, without ever really taking the material in and LEARNING. However, as mentioned above, you will be guaranteed an A as long as you can keep up.With all of this in mind, I think that AP50a is a good course if you are solely looking for a good grade, as you WILL earn an A as long as you do everything. However, do not enter with the expectation to truly learn, and be ready to spend countless moments of the semester focused on the next, upcoming assignment for AP50a to ensure you keep that A.",0.988,"Be very careful with this class. The idea of having no exams, and just ""having to complete my work"" sounded amazing. What I didn't know was how incredibly laborious and PAINFUL that work was. The structure of the course is so beyond convoluted and confusing, there is SO much work to do and so many deadlines throughout the week, the TFs are incredibly picky with the wording you use and the way you say things, and the whole class you feel like you're scrambling to finish.

From someone that took AP50a and will be continuing with AP50b, here are my honest thoughts about the course. As many suggest from previous Q–Reports, AP50a is a course where you will learn literally NOTHING, but walk away with an A as long as you put in the time and effort (although be forewarned, that time is going to be A LOT).For context, the structure of the class includes a LOT of weekly assignments, as listed below:• Sunday by 11:59 PM – Reading Assessment: you are expected to read about 20–30 pages in the textbook and leave about 10–15 comments to ‘stimulate conversation’ with your peers• Sunday by 11:59 PM – Readiness Assurance (Individual): you complete around 10–20 practice questions individually based on the topics you learned from reading• Tuesday by 9 AM – Tutorial (Individual): you complete an application–based assignment on Desmos consisting of about 20–30 slides on the weekly topics you learned from reading• Tuesday IN CLASS – Tutorial (Team): you review over the Desmos tutorial assignment with your team and complete check–ins with the teaching staff + correct your answers – ONLY THIS ROUND IS GRADED• Tuesday by 6 PM – Readiness Assurance (Team Round): you re–visit the Readiness Assurance from Sunday with your team and re–submit what you think is correct – ONLY THIS ROUND IS GRADED• Thursday by 9 AM – Challenge (Individual): you complete a 3 question problem set individually before class and submit to Gradescope• Thursday IN CLASS – Challenge (Team): you review over your challenge with your team and complete check–ins with the teaching staff + correct your answers – ONLY THIS ROUND IS GRADED• Thursday IN CLASS – Skill Session: you take your newly learned concepts from the week and put it into practice by completing different activities + a short Canvas quiz – ONLY THIS ROUND IS GRADEDAs you can see, there are a minimum of at least EIGHT weekly assignments you will have to do in AP50, which combined with the in–class component, means that you are spending around 15 hours/week MINIMUM to complete your objectives. The plus side to this is that AP50a contains NO EXAMS and also only grades your TEAM sessions, which means that only your CORRECTED copy of the Challenge + Tutorial are counted. However, this makes for a very unintuitive and time consuming way of learning, as you have no lectures and only learn based off of a short textbook reading and some random assignments. The truth about AP50a is, if you do all of the tasks outlined above, you are GUARANTEED an A. They do not lie or trick students, and are very straight forward with the requirements. However, just be warned that you MUST stay on track and complete EVERYTHING on time, as even missing ONE assignment or having ONE dissatisfactory grade will automatically bump you down a letter grade. As a result, AP50a is only a good fit for those that are able to stay on top of their work.From a classroom dynamics perspective, AP50 is very interesting. In terms of the teaching team, some of the TFs do not seem adequately prepared and often make odd mistakes. Every Tuesday and Thursday, students do “check in sessions” with the TF where they present their group’s final answers to the Tutorial and/or Challenge and get feedback. However, there have been multiple instances of TFs either being extremely rude and unhelpful, or straight up providing inaccurate and wrong information. This also extends to grading, where they have accidentally docked students for things they cannot even identify later on when asked. This even extends into the actual structure of the class, as there have been multiple instances where there are issues with the Canvas page or associated assignments (as with a huge banner across one of the Tutorials on Demos telling the teaching team to remove a section of the assignment, even though it was still there and had already been published). Unfortunately, this made the class seem very poorly unorganized and like an afterthought in some regards.Now that we’re a semester in, to be honest, I do not think I have learned much from AP50a. Although the course boasts this reputation and *big idea* of using a different teaching approach that is meant to enable students to learn by DOING, the course falls short of this in many ways. At the end of the day, you will basically turn into an automated machine each week with completing each of the assignments, without ever really taking the material in and LEARNING. However, as mentioned above, you will be guaranteed an A as long as you can keep up.With all of this in mind, I think that AP50a is a good course if you are solely looking for a good grade, as you WILL earn an A as long as you do everything. However, do not enter with the expectation to truly learn, and be ready to spend countless moments of the semester focused on the next, upcoming assignment for AP50a to ensure you keep that A.",0.988,"Be very careful with this class.

You can try it out if it is with another professor. This is truly one of the worst courses I’ve taken in my entire academic career. I do not understand how a course—especially one that serves as a requirement for new AFVS graduate students and has been in existence for years—could be taught in such a way. 1. Lack of Basic Organization: I don’t understand why some readings are included in the syllabus when they weren’t discussed or connected to any future readings. Each week feels completely disjointed from the others. While I understand that this is intended to be a broad survey course in Film & Visual Studies, it neither traces the genealogy of theoretical engagement within the field nor even attempts to explain why the figures we read are important. It feels more like a list of readings than a cohesive curriculum. I’m sure that other professors, who are more familiar with the field’s recent developments, could have created a syllabus that is more relevant and engaging. 2. Lack of Structured Class Time: We did not have “class” in the traditional sense. I’ve experienced many different styles of teaching in graduate seminars, and I’m usually very open to them. However, this class was beyond me. I don’t understand how a two–hour class is structured into: one hour of student presentations, 50 minutes of the professor telling trivia and life stories, and 10 minutes of questions from the teaching fellow, often focusing on irrelevant issues and grilling people on them. I had many questions and would have loved to discuss them with my classmates. Our cohort brought diverse knowledge from various fields, but we were never allowed the time to engage with each other. Because of the time spent on other “important” matters, I didn’t learn much in this class, and I’m sure my classmates would agree with me. A professor who genuinely cared about how their class went would have noticed that student participation stopped after Week 5. While you might think this means that it's less work for you, it is not. You're left confused on all the assignments and all the ""instructions"" come post hoc in the form of criticism on things you didn't even know were in consideration.  3. Lack of Accessibility from the Professor: The professor is NEVER accessible. The only interaction I had with Professor Giuliana Bruno was when I asked her a question after class, and her response was a single sentence. She doesn’t respond to emails, does not hold office hours, and never provides any feedback on our assignments. I don’t understand why she’s considered a “teacher.” On the bright side, she is not a mean person. She will say hi to you if you encounter each other in the Carpenter Center.  4. Disparaging Teaching Fellow: The teaching fellow, Aden Solway, was incredibly disparaging to everyone.

This course is NOT a gem, or easy, or anything like that. On the contrary, this course requires a stupendous amount of work, both in the classroom and out. This is a very conceptually difficult class because of how new/different the material is (most people have never studied something like this before) as well as the volume of material that is taught on (CelNav is a very complex discipline with many moving parts). In the beginning of the semester I thought that the Tuesday night labs (19–2200) were going to be relatively easy but as the semester progressed, they became a significant drain on both my time to complete other assignments as well as my sleep schedule. The star/sun journal that they make you keep is also extremely time consuming. The P–Sets can be nightmarish, depending on how well you know the material. Why you should take this course is because you will never get another chance to do celestial navigation again in your life. My advice would be take this class pass–fail, make every use of office hours (which they are very generous with), and use this class to satisfy your QRD requirement. The professor and the teaching staff are extremely personable and likable people who love students.Take the class, but don't let anyone say that it wasn’t work.

They definitely weed out at the beginning, and you must be serious about taking this class. It is conceptually difficult, but VERY well structured, and if you’re willing to put the time in, you are 100% capable of learning. That being said, heed the prerequisites. They don’t say much about linear algebra, but I would strongly caution against taking this class without at least reviewing some linear algebra concepts first. It is also quite math and computationally heavy, relative to any chemistry courses you will likely have taken.The course staff are through and through phenomenal. Adam is a super engaging lecturer and I stayed interested for the entire period, which is rare. Section was helpful too.The only downside to this course is the lab. Yes, three hours of matlab a week is indeed that bad. The lab staff were super fun and made it livable, but it’s a rough one. You will learn a ton from labs (mainly how to stay alive and not completely crash out for 3 hours while your homemade spectrometer decides not to work). However, some of the labs were only loosely related to lecture, and when you have three midterms, and lab isn’t covered intensely, it’s hard to lock in. There is simply too much to do for the rest of the class.The final project is fun if you pick something good. You have to seek your own help, because they throw you in the deep end. When they mention a potential project topic during lecture, PAY ATTENTION. Those deadlines sneak up on you, because they also overlap with the third midterm. The third midterm was also the day after H–Y weekend, and the second was after family weekend, so keep that in mind. It does feel like you’re constantly preparing for a midterm, but with no final exam, you can’t really complain. Overall, STRONGLY RECOMMEND.

Professor Myers is a great lecturer and really knows his stuff, but be prepared to spend A LOT of time on this class memorizing the material. Here's how the course worked for me: in class, Professor Myers presented a flurry of mechanisms and reactions, and I quickly copied those down (be prepared to write fast). I didn't really understand them the first time around (this is okay) because it's a challenge to keep up with Myers' pace, but it's nothing to worry about Next, I would attempt the Lecture Integration problems (a short worksheet based on the new content from the last lecture that is due every lecture)  to test my knowledge. Then, I would look over the pset and see how much I remembered, and do the first few problems. Then, I would look back at the lecture boards / lecture recordings as a guide, and attempt all the other problems, and go to office hours and check everything one more time before submitting my pset. For tests, there are ample practice materials, but be sure to do ALL of them: I know I definitely needed the practice. If you do all the practice materials, the exams will feel fair and simple.Chem 30 is a HARD class, but it was definitely an enjoyable experience. Everyone is pretty much in the same boat: you will need to memorize a LOT of reactions, but it all feels fun and new. Your synthetic capabilities will grow exponentially compared to just having taken Chem 20. Finally, the community in the course is excellent. The teaching staff is absolutely stellar: they are super qualified and really know their stuff. The other students are also struggling through the same content you are, so it's not hard to make new friends. All in all, Chem 30 demands a large time commitment, but is an awesome class with great people.",0.9968,"PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE!!! I really enjoyed Chem 20, but this class is a mess and the high reviews on the Q guide are very misleading because it is filled with Chemistry majors that will rank chemistry classes high regardless of whether it is a good class. If you are not a chemistry major, I would highly advise taking Chem 27 instead. I think the optimal series is Chem 20 and then Chem 27.There are many problems with Chem 20:1) it is simply a memorization game––there are hundreds of reactions given to you and you simply have to memorize the reagents involved, the mechanisms involved, and when to use them. Any one of them could show up at any time, on any assignment. Unlike Chem 20 where I felt like I was learning a new way of thinking about chemistry, this course was just drilling reaction after reaction into my brain, which wasn't fun or rewarding. If you took Chem 20, you have already learned how to do synthesis; you don't need this class to advance that skill.2) The structure of this course is really bad all around. First, don't let the 2x a week lectures fool you. These lectures consist of Professor Myers writing reaction after reaction after reaction after reaction on the board. Then it is entirely on you to actually learn the material. You will retain essentially nothing in lecture and Professor Myers does nothing to engage students during the lectures. Second, EVERYTHING IS ON PAPER, which may sound fine, but it gets really frustrating because you have to print everything (the daily lecture problems and the problem sets) if you do work on the iPad. This was a bit crazy for 2024. Third, there was often complex material on the problem sets that was taught the day before the long PSETS were due, which meant trying to watch youtube videos that covered the material or begging CAs for the answers because there just wasn't enough time to wait to actually learn the material in class.3) Some of the exam questions were unfair and covered material that wasn't taught. After we got the test back, I tried to find where some of the material was in the course materials and frequently it just wasn't there. The material is hard enough that asking about material that wasn't taught or introduced is a bit unfair.____________Finally, if you are premed, this class is not a way around the 17/27 series. You will learn more and find the material more interesting in the Chem 17/27 classes. This class is very hard and filled with people who have been doing chemistry their entire life (olympiad kids and international chemistry kids), so even if the curve is slightly more generous, you are taking this class with an entirely different population of people than Chem 17 and 27.

The content of the course is definitely the biggest strength: it was super cool to see how to apply chemistry and biology to therapeutic development, which is very much still an emerging and prevalent science. Professor Shair is extremely knowledgeable, and as the founder of a biopharma company (Nuvalent) himself, he knows all the ins and outs of the industry. However, the course does have some quirks and drawbacks, namely, the workload, community, and office hours and feedback.– Workload. On average, this class is not a lot of work at all, but the workload is just extremely concentrated. There are only 5 assignments: A section presentation on a week of your choice, 2 Psets, a Midterm (which is a glorified Pset with less time and no collaboration), and a Final Project. On weeks when you don't have any of these to do, the course is extremely chill, only about an hour of out–of–classroom time for the week (you only need to read a paper for section and that's it– lecture attendance is not recorded and you can watch it whenever you want). However, on weeks when you have one of these assignments to do, be prepared to GRIND. The psets and midterm are a grind, which took me ~20 hours to do for each. The final project was not explained very well, so be prepared to put in A LOT of work for it. – Community. The class is like 70% grad students, so if you're in undergrad, you probably won't find many new friends with similar experiences in the class. The grad students are still chill on average, don't get me wrong, but don't expect this to have the same undergrad community as Chem 20/30 or 17/27.– Office hours and feedback.

I think both have a lot of ups and downs. For LPSA, the coursework may be too demanding for someone with no experience but very slow for anyone with any AP experience. I took this class because I was worried about my chemistry knowledge. The last time I took chemistry before this course was sophomore year of high school, and I never learned about solubility or acids and bases. I found this class to be very easy and boring at times. I definitely don't regret taking the class though. Many of my LS1A peers were much more stressed out than I was. If you are worried about the pace being too slow, probably take LS1A. However, I have heard from LS1A students that they end up learning very little. I did really like the teaching staff. Tucci is super interested in the subject, and he's a very lively lecturer for 9AM. I also enjoyed the demonstrations, and the labs were very nice. I especially liked my lab TF. Dr. Boselli is very nice too, and she's always willing to answer questions.While I did not attend help rooms, I was told they were extremely helpful to most students. If you are worried about receiving support, I strongly recommend LPSA. The staff will help you with any questions you have step by step.

You feel like a cool hacker in a movie when you're doing it. All of the psets I had such a blast doing. YES it is going to take hours and hours and hours––BUT it is such a fun process. It is not too difficult––most of it you will be able to do on your own from the lectures and course website and when you get stuck the TFs are incredible and wednesday office hours with pizza are always such a blast. After taking so much theory courses (120 and 124), this course reminded me of the joy of coding again. It was genuinely such a fun time, you just get to solve fun little problem sets with your code and the staff and resources provide it make it challenging but so doable and so so enjoyable. I genuinely do not know why it gets so many bad reviews. I had such a blast. Have so so much fun taking it :) If you go to lectures and see the problem sets as fun puzzle games (don't start them too late or you will just be stressed and won't be able to enjoy them!), then I promise you will have such a great time.",0.9987,"I really enjoyed this class, but I made the mistake of taking two hard classes at the same time.

Furthermore, a lot of the theory that you learn is pretty applicable to industry CS, and is especially helpful for things such as time and space complexity. The course also has a ton of great resources, with organized lectures and lecture notes, wonderful sections which recap the topics learned during the week, and a very good textbook which clarifies most of the lecture material. If you attend/watch lectures, go to section, and read the textbook, you'll do more than fine in the class.

This puts it easily in first place followed by CS61, CS124, and Stat 111 at 193, 180, 172 hours total. In all cases, these times including _everything_ done for the class. Suffice it to say, this class has a HEAVY workload. If I had attempted more of the extra credit and interesting add–ons to the project, I would have easily been able to put in 300+ hours into this class. So, the usual warnings of time management apply here. You might notice that I put in almost no time in the first third of the course. This was, in my opinion, a massive mistake.In the beginning, you will start with a handout code of a couple hundred lines. However, by the end, you will end up writing 6000+ lines of code. In my case, I ended up writing 9979 lines of .c and .h code. Of course there are empty and comment lines included in that, but you see my point. As such, code organization will be very important. For example, your project will need code to parse and execute various database operators. How will you do this? Perhaps consider putting each operator into its own file such as parse_select.c and execute_select.c as an example. Similarly, there will need to be thought put into the load and print commands whose execution will require logic dissimilar than the other operators. How will you deal with cases where you need to find a specific result column from its handle? How about when you need to find a database column from its full name? how about finding the specific entry in the client context for a relevant search? How will you handle database persistance? Where will code for btree and sorted index creation go? In the file with execute_create? maybe a separate create_index.c file? Where will the functions doing the search within the indices go? There is just simply a lot of code to be written. Think about semantic ways of separating your code into different files. If not, your files such as db_manager, parse and execute will baloon to thousands of lines. If using vscode, things like ctrl shift o, ctrl p, and various vim–esque keyboard shortcuts will be increase your productivity. The lectures were very dissimilar to other lecture–style CS classes I took. I was with a great cohort of students and we tried our best to ask so so many questions. We questioned everything and Stratos was great and he encouraged us in that. I think this class wins the award for the most knowledge learnt through slides per word on the slides :D To the point and keeps the focus on the conversation we are having with Stratos. CS165 has the most generous course policies of any course. I want to thus go into a tangent on the many many generosities shown by the class. Both exams are take–home and start at 9AM and last until 12pm the next day. It is open book, open computer, open internet, AND, most importantly, open people! You are able to talk through the problems with others taking the class! Of course your writeup needs to be done separately, but this is the kind of confidence they have in their problems and in their teaching philosophy. I learned so much from the back–and–forth discussions we had when trying to come up with the best algorithm for a task. How is it that the Midterm _taught_ me something? Incredible. The class has almost no deadlines. There is a midway check–in mid october by which you need to pass the first 3 of the 59 tests. This is to give you a sense of the gigantic scope of this project compared to any other class you have ever taken. Beyond that, there is only one deadline, the final one. Essentially, the course trusts you completely and leaves almost everything to you. You make any kind of design decisions. The midterms were fine. There is extra credit galore in each midterm and your first midterm doesn't count if you do better on your second. Nothing to worry about. ezpz. I highly suggest using Ubuntu/Linux for developing this project. You will be directly developing in the OS that your testing server will use. You will also be able to compile and run natively without worrying about cstdlib functions not being present on mac or windows. Please god please don't use windows.  `gdb` is essential for this project. Specifically, learn how to create a .gdbinit file and create various layouts which will come in handy. A particularly useful layout for me was `tui new–layout <layout_name> {–horizontal src 3} 2 cmd 1`. You can switch to this layout using `layout <layout_name>`. Learn also how to use vgdb to use gdb together with valgrind for a powerful duo. I heavily suggest using tmux as a terminal multiplexer. Learning it and setting it up as I like is has been an absolute game changer. For example, I didn't do this myself and it cost me dear time at the end: create a test execution script that can start the server and client processes as well as can input specific tests into the client. Use the test generation scripts to create tests of different magnitudes. You should at least create the 10million row version of the tests. Then, develop your project only using the larger tests. I personally always used a 1million row dataset and its tests. It served me very well. 10 million is for the stress tests. For example, did you know that there is a max limit size of a stack allocated array? This means any stack allocated array should make sure it doesn't go past that size. This is very niche: the course uses C99 but C99 does not have a address aligned malloc function. HOWEVER, you can create one yourself if you would like. The way you do this can be found on the internet, but what this allowes you to do is to assume almost every memory region you allocated is cache/page aligned. How about that :DSome Areas that the course could improve upon: 1– The CS165 language needs to be updated. For example, there are tests that require single–threaded execution. Thus, there is a single_core() and single_core_execute() command that essentially enable and disable multicode performance. Very easy to implement, however, it must be included in the language regardless. 2– Certain things about the project need to be clarified. For example, it is possible for certain tests to create an internal variable, say s1, and then overwrite it with a new result also named s1. However, at least from my look at the project, there is no text on whether this is allowed. 3– The create column command specification is `create(col,<col_name>,<tbl_var>)` however, the examples shown just below it show examples such as `create(col,""project"",awesomebase.grades,unsorted)`. However, this `unsorted` argument is not allowed given the language. These kinds of inconsistencies need to be resolved and not left to be clarified every year using Ed. 4– Many students including me experience issues with permissions and with the docker container running as root. This is extremely unnecessary and dangerous I believe. If the docker container has any issues, it will execute with root access. My docker container should not be able to nuke my computer :D I mean this is an exageration, but there is no reason to not have a basic user such as `cs165–student`. This would remove a lot of issues with root permissions. For example, after every time I used run_mile with the make file, it compiles the project with the docker root user. Thus, I need to then run a `sudo` make clean instead of just being to use my normal user. I needed to use sudo so much and I find that this is not good practice and makes it so unnecessary. I had input mu 25 char password every time I needed to do this. I seriously considered reducing my computer's password length or removing it entirely to stop password authentication every single time I needed to compile my code after a run_mile. 5– Some of the section recordings are extremely old and the audio and video quality is really showing its age. I would humbly that the class invest some TF time to rerecord these videos with hopefully better production. 6– Certain things mentioned in the milestone requirements turned out to be optional and worth extra credit point. The course needs to clarify what counts as a minimum and what not. For example, I later in the course learned that there would be no inserts done after index creation. This meant that I could make many assumptions about my structure. This lead me to design a –I think– novel way to store the btree in memory without needing a reference to each node's start address. I literally halved my btree size and made it perform much better in terms of cache locality. Final thoughts:There is so much to say about this class, but just know that this class really cares about your success. There were office hours and help available almost every single day. What can I say, I feel that I didn't make the most of this class and I could have done so much more for this class. I am definitely going to implement the project in Rust at some point:D I wish you luck. If class difficulty is not an immediate no for you, then class will deliver. Take the plunge and learn how one can learn so much in just a semester. Like, the largest project I had worked on before this has 2800 lines of python code. Of course, c gets way less done in the same number of lines, but still, this was a big personal achievement for me to have finished this.

CONTENTThe course covered a wide variety of topics in training foundation models. In particular, it began with basic backprop + gradient descent, edge of stability, optimization techniques and theory, sharding, training pipeline (pre/mid/post), parallelization, generative AI, inference, with interspersed topics taught by guest lectures: Jonathan Frankle (databricks), Roy Frostig (jax), Julia Neagu / Deanna Emery (QuotientAI), Vahan Petrosyan / Leo Linden (SuperAnnotate), and Jacob Austin (Google Deepmind). The main instructors for the content were Sham and various Kempner postdocs. The material is largely interesting, but not very organized.  Some of the lectures were quite interesting, for instance Frankle discussed some relatively original takes; the first two lectures had some intriguing theoretical content, etc. However, several lectures depend critically on familiarity; for instance, I think it is very difficult to take anything out of a jax lecture if one has not worked with the language before. For many lectures, without references or implementation exercises, it was difficult to take something concrete; for instance, in either the parallelization lectures or the generative AI lectures (both of which were interesting, but some exercises would have been nice). Overall, a fun class to take which is low–workload and is essentially a sequence of seminar talks, and not necessarily an organized and very rigorous course.HWThere were three HWs which constituted two of Sasha Rush’s puzzles (available publicly on GitHub). This caused the class to be very easy in terms of workload; however, I wish there were HW assignments which more accurately described the content. For instance, it would have been nice to actually train a model using parallel compute, actually implement some of the optimization techniques, use JAX, implement generative models (e.g. diffusion, etc.). PROJECTThere is a project at the end of the course. This project is pretty open–ended and is a good opportunity for students to engage in some original work in ML, and I appreciate it as the only major assignment of the course. There are a few milestones where we received decent feedback. Again, I think it would have been nice for there to be some starting guidelines, possibly in the HW assignments, for places to start; generating ideas was an interesting but relatively nontrivial process.",0.9959,Very rigorous and goes into substantial technical depth.

HT is a great professor, and it is a real honor to be able to learn from a man with such deep, encyclopedic knowledge of the field. The material is also simultaneously incredibly broad and deep (there's just a lot of it!), and I've really come away feeling like I've learned a lot about systems and efficient ML more generally.The PSETs were very manageable, the midterm was not that bad, and the quizzes were annoying and tedious but they only lasted for the first half of the class. Definitely a pretty tough class, but it's all so worth it.The final project is really interesting: the constant feedback from HT makes it unusual in that you are guaranteed to have something good, that you can be proud of by the end, but it is also the highest expectation I've ever seen for a final project at this university (not like, a PhD thesis like i saw a previous comment say, but definitely non–trivial and you need good, novel results, which are not always easy to come by).HT is also the greatest PowerPoint user I've ever seen, his slides are fantastic and unlike any other prof's.Sit in the front row to be able to follow lecture closely, do not give into the temptation to pull your laptop out when you get confused, and interact with the staff as much as you can, it's just uniformly good for you to do so.A great way to knock out the systems requirement at the undergrad or AB/SM level. 10/10 would recommend and take again.",0.9969,"I do not recommend this course, and I say this as someone who was very excited to take it and was interested in this line of research. There are too many issues, and even the opportunity to learn from such a professor as Prof HTK does not make up for it. – You cannot hear him during lecture. He does not speak clearly, though this may not be his fault but rather a technical issue with the microphone. Either way you will go to class and hear something very garbled and the recording is even worse. You quite literally can hear nothing unless you sit right in front of the professor. He is brilliant but this is a problem that I feel should be fixed; he is capable of speaking clearly because he does every 30 minutes or so for one or two sentences and then you cannot hear anything again. – The course staff who are hired to answer your questions seem to not like it when you ask them questions. If you ask them about specifics for the coding assignments, the people I asked said they didn’t know. I wondered how they did not know but that was irrelevant because no matter the reason, I did not receive help and was slightly screwed. – The quizzes are ridiculous. The questions themselves are not crazy, but the time limit of 12 minutes for 10 questions seems to be something unrealistic — as if you ask the TF about a question sometimes they take 3–4 mins to think of an answer, so how are we supposed to do the same in 1–2mins as people who are seeing the content for the first time?– Every assignment with the exception of the first will be in a group. This group may not be people you know, and even if it is, you will come to learn just how lazy and unresponsive some of your peers can be. I would in general for CS avoid group based assignment classes if you can.– The final exam requires that you remember exact things from the lecture slides, sometimes useless details. For example, they test you on a concept where there are multiple possible parameters, but instead of quizzing actual understanding they ask about what exact values for the parameters were used in class. There is a special circumstance in which i recommend you take this course1) You are actually willing to read the papers in detail and are deeply interested in hardware and software AI acceleration techniques2) You have an idea before going in of possible projects you might want to pursue 3) You are going to ask questions in class and the course staff will like you if you ask intelligent research–like questions but not really about HW4) You will be a good team member, and you are willing to pick up the slack for the slackers who are not.",-0.674,,0.0,Computing at Scale,COMPSCI 2420,H.

All professors are super high–energy and encouraging! But PLEASE consider these before taking BA (for context, I'm a STEM major who didn't have a language requirement to fulfill, I was doing Mandarin because I just really wanted to learn it):– This is an intro course, but many people here already have a background, either because they took Chinese in High School or because they are heritage speakers (there is another course for heritage speakers, but many do BA as a convenient way to tackle the language requirement). This can be very frustrating if you feel like you are not keeping up with the rest of your section, so have that in mind before comparing yourself to others! It's still annoying tho.– This course is SUPER FAST PACED. I took two demanding PSET classes and a seminar heavy in readings while taking BA and still had BA as my biggest concern. Be prepared to spend a lot of time doing homework (and I really mean a lot of time, I would often have to thoroughly review the whole lesson before even getting started with the first question).– The course before and after the add–drop period is not the same. In the first weeks, it seems much more manageable than it actually is during the rest of the semester.– Office hours happen during morning and early afternoon. The very own course professors run them  (there are no student TFs or CAs) and they are very good, but keep in mind that scheduling them can be annoying if you have a busy class routine from 9 am to 3 pm.– Going to Vanserg every day got increasingly annoying during the semester (It's a beautiful walk tho! A side of the campus you don't often get to explore as an undergrad. But definitely a commute, particularly if you have classes close to lunch time or in locations like the Allston Campus).With that being said, if you want to learn Chinese, take this course! But if you're a REAL beginner, like, 0 Chinese background (which is in theory the target demographic of the course), keep in mind there is a HOMERIC amount of effort and time you'll be putting in this class. This is not meant to discourage you from taking the course, but I really missed more Q reviews that emphasized this aspect and I don't know if I would have taken the class if I was well aware of it.

I feel that this is a very good but rather challenging class, especially as a first–year. The workload is equivalent to a pset class, as you have a weekly homework assignment that takes time. On the homework, do the extra credit every single time. It takes only 5 minutes but it will make a huge difference for your grade. There is also a quiz every single Tuesday and Thursday, which covers content for the NEXT lesson (not the previous one). Keep this in mind when you consider your workload and which classes you want to take. The assignments are very much focused on reading, writing, and grammar. I came from a conversationally–focused Chinese program in high school, so this was a big shift for me. If you don't feel confident in your reading and writing (typing) abilities, I would suggest taking Ba or Bb if you want a less demanding experience.  The project is worth a significant proportion of your grade, so do not blow it off. If you use it as an opportunity to genuinely learn about Chinese culture,  you will love it!Do not be discouraged if you perform poorly on the review tests or midterm. They are very hard but  there are plenty of other assignments and  extra credit opportunities to help your grade. The final exam is very hard, too. The instructors are all incredible teachers and care so deeply about their students' success in this class. I cannot say enough good things about them. They are always willing to help, and also make class into a fun environment. A highlight was the tea party they had for us. Because I took a very challenging set of classes this semester, there is a small part of me that wishes I took a lower level class. However, I am ultimately glad I took 120a because I truly learned so much and had a great experience thanks to the instructors.

I know as an incoming freshman, I wanted to know what the student got with their perspective, which is why I am putting this here. So here's what I have to say:– If you have not taken economics before, like me, get ready to lock in. At first, it is going to seem like common sense, but it picks up quite quickly. The midterm will be more difficult then you think and be ready for that. All of the other qreports from what I read before coming was that it was going to be pretty easy, but please please please study. – If you mess up on the midterm (any students), DON'T WORRY! I didn't do amazing on the midterm, but I pulled out an A on the final, which saved my grade. It is possible, I promise! If you didn't understand the midterm that well, please go back and understand it. It will come back into the future concepts and you will only get more lost if you do not put in the effort immediately. – If you did well on the midterm, do NOT let off the gas pedal. I know students who got high A's on the midterm and get C's on the final. The class does get harder and it is not as easy as other people say it is.– Do your problem sets with one of those office hours that goes over the entire problem set. For me, this semester was with Jack Kelly, which was so beneficial for my pset grade. Psets are worth 25% of your grade and this is an easy way to help you get that A at the end!– Finally, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE do the Unit Review Programs. These are easy 2% extra credit bonuses on your final grade! This is what got me my A (I think). It literally could be the difference between an A and an A–, so please please please go. It's like one hour out of your week, every two weeks. Just go and get your extra credit!",0.9981,"Having taken IB Economics, the course was repetitive and boring.

If you are choosing an ECON 970 section, I would strongly recommend considering this option, especially if you are interested in behavioral economics or financial concepts. We went over many interesting topics, ranging from momentum trading and behavioral phenomena such as investor attention, to unique topics like meme stocks. It was a fair amount of work, with two short (~1 page) papers per week near the beginning of the semester, moving to working on components of the final paper near the end of the semester. I was very thankful for this format because it gave the opportunity to receive consistent feedback so you can improve with each assignment, and it made it nearly impossible to procrastinate too badly on the final paper. Professor Landoni is also a fantastic instructor who clearly cares a lot about his students, and is very available to answer questions and give feedback.

For studying for the exams, the bulk of what I did was just reviewing the MCQs and LPs, as they are very useful. In some ways, I almost found Ec1010a easier than Ec10a at times because the LPs and MCQs were so difficult, and the exams were easier in comparison. Also, definitely go to lecture and do the CRQs, as these also appear on MCQs and exams and are super helpful for deepening your knowledge. And find a study group for the MCQs early!!

It is shocking how little thought seemed to go into making this class a worthwhile educational experience. Here are just a few of the glaring issues that made this class worth avoiding if possible:Problem Sets: A Marathon of TediumThe problem sets were absurdly long, often nearing 100 questions. This would be bad enough if they were meaningful, but they were anything but. Instead of fostering understanding, they devolved into tedious calculation marathons that added no real value to mastering the material. To make matters worse, many of the problems were structured to cascade: if you made a single mistake early on, it snowballed, guaranteeing you got several more questions wrong. This setup punished even minor errors and discouraged actual learning.Lectures: A Waste of TimeThe lectures were utterly unhelpful. The professor’s slides were crammed with irrelevant math and equations—stuff that didn’t even align with the level of understanding required for the course. Rather than clarifying or simplifying concepts, the lectures left students more confused. If you walked in hoping for clear, concise explanations, you walked out disappointed (and more stressed than when you came in).Exams: Unreasonably Difficult and ArbitraryThe midterm and final exams were very difficult—not because they tested mastery of the material, but because they were riddled with random, nitpicky questions. It’s absurd to expect students to recall obscure tidbits from readings or parse the meaning of some minor detail on a graph buried in the lengthy textbook or one of the many readings assigned. This format doesn’t measure understanding—it’s a scavenger hunt designed to trip students up. Add in the multiple–choice calculation problems, and you’ve got a recipe for disaster. A single small math error meant getting multiple questions wrong. This is an economics course, not a math competition!Overall Experience: Frustrating and PointlessUltimately, this course completely failed to fulfill the purpose of an economics class: TEACHING ECONOMICS. The relentless focus on excessive calculations and arbitrary details detracted from any meaningful engagement with broader concepts or critical thinking. Instead of leaving the class feeling enriched, I walked away frustrated, burnt out, and deeply disappointed. Every review I read on the Q before taking this course proved accurate, showing that the professor and the economics department clearly have no interest in improving this course or providing an enriching experience for future economists. If you're reading this and considering taking this course, don’t be surprised if nothing changes. If you’re taking this course as a requirement, it’s doable, so don’t stress too much. However, don’t expect to gain much from it—it’s unlikely you’ll walk away feeling like a more confident macroeconomist.",-0.9944,,0.0,Intermediate Macroeconomics,ECON 1010B,Thomas Baranga,2025 Fall,Full Term,2025-09-02,2025-12-03,10:30am,11:45am,Mon Wed,12666,No Consent,0,0,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,"Theories and evidence on economic growth and fluctuations.

But boy was I wrong about the relative difficulty. I thought that Ec1011 would be mind–boggling hard and Stat110 would be a walk in the park but I could not be more wrong. I thought that Stat110 was a much harder course than Ec1011 for a couple of reasons: (1) Stat has a wide distribution of student abilities so some people get 95 or 100s on the tests, while others get 40s and this means it is much harder to get a good grade as you need to compete relatively against some strong classmates. However in Ec1011, everyone, no matter how much of a math genius they are, does poorly on the test (around a 50 with a tight SD) so if you are just average like me, you won’t suffer under the intelligence of your smarter peers. (2) Ec1011 is just multivariable calculus and taking derivatives which is much more algorithmic (and you have practice in HS), so the math can be messy but it is not extraordinarily difficult. Also the economic logic taught in the course is very self–intuitive, so you can generally know a sensible answer to the question.  However with Stat, it is much more about logical, creative problem solving akin to competition math problems which was harder for me (and many others) as you’re not taught in high school how to solve math problems creatively and find a neat trick that makes the problem a lot easier. I found that Ec was more manageable as everyone is similarly lost together in lecture and the class, while in Stat everyone is expected to understand the material, so if you take both classes at the same time, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND SPENDING MORE TIME ON STAT — your grade in Econ will only improve by so much and you can take the time to study the material around the midterm and final when Aakaash’s review sections give you a good sense of what will be on the test. Spend the much more important weekly time on getting started on the Stat psets early and building your problem solving skills there. EC1011a vs. Ec1010a For those on the fence, I would highly recommend taking Ec1011a over 1010. (1) In 1011, a majority of the students get an A– or above as the curve is now more lenient than it used to be (coming from Prof. Glaeser himself) as it needs to more closely match the 1010 grade distribution. I think college is about taking classes that will challenge you and where you will learn a lot (1011), rather than taking a sleepy class where you can coast by and not get the full Harvard experience (1010), so I implore you to ponder about whether you want to make your college experience rewarding and intellectually stimulating or coast by in boredom/ambivalence and wonder why you spend so much money to take boring classes.  (2) The material and skills you learn in 1011 are MUCH MORE satisfying than in 1010. In 1011, you understand and appreciate the importance of modeling in economics and it introduces key concepts like insurance, moral hazard, intertemporal consumption, and monopolies in a much more interesting manner. (3) Professor Glaeser is an incredibly accomplished professor, and despite the fact that he lectures at an incredibly fast pace and takes partials at the speed of light, it felt like taking use of Harvard’s resources to hear from a potential future Nobel laureate. His theory on spatial equilibrium and special topics on the economics of crime, hatred and cities are eye–opening and reveal why microeconomics is such an interesting topic and the variety of ways it can be applied. (4) The first couple weeks of 1011 are designed to scare people off and they are actually the toughest in the course (it gets easier from there). The math before the midterm is really messy and scary, but after the midterm the topics become more interesting, the math is simpler and people are just tired of doing crazy math, so it gets easier from there. If you can survive the early rough patches, you will be in for a great course. Tips to succeed in the course 1. Read/Gloss over ALL the lecture slides before Ed’s lectures. He speeds through material at a speed of light in lecture and even the most smart math people I know couldn’t keep up pace sometimes with how fast he took derivatives. Reading through the lecture slides in advance to understand how he set up a model or does the math will be great so that in class you can just focus on understanding the economic intuition that is much more valuable to grasp in this course. 2. Go to office hours to do psets. The psets (at least in the beginning) are mathematically intense so showing up to office hours and doing them under the guidance of the CA are useful so you aren’t led astray. Also the wording can be confusing and vague so great to get their advice about what the question is aksing you to solve. 3. Psets are graded on completion — if you are hacking away at math and can’t quite get the right answer just move on. As long as you do/attempt 75% of the pset and spend a good 5 hours, you will come away with full marks so don’t stress4. Attend Aakaash’s review section. These are incredible useful not only when it comes to studying for the midterm/finals, but also for reviewing the weekly lecture material as he draws on it for TFUs and questions on the exams. 5. Understand that you will only understand 50% of Ed’s lectures. He breezes by lecture content as he is very smart and there is a ton of material packed in, so know that you are not alone in barely being able to follow with his lectures 6. Go into the lecture with a goal of understanding the intuition and not the math. The intuition is very important in this course — that’s what the tests generally test you on, and the math can be secondary to that. No one will really understand the math on your first go, but you always have the time to review the slides and ask the course staff later about math questions. But Ed doesn’t record lecture and can breeze through the logic of the all–important economic intuition so focus on that.",0.9986,Lectures are extremely confusing if you try to follow the math.

One of the key strengths is the flexibility of the course structure. You can sign up for any section that fits your schedule, and each section is led by different TFs or past students, which brings varied insights to the material. Additionally, the optional writing requirement is a great feature—it only accounts for 5% of the grade and is graded leniently, making it an easy way to boost your grade. The grading is generous overall, with a curve, and the course workload is manageable (e.g., there is no homework). However, it’s important to stay on top of the readings and class discussions. Another strength is the accessibility of lecture materials, with slides and videos posted on Canvas, allowing students to review the content at their own pace. As I anticipated, the grading structure was oversimplified: it consists of three (and optionally four) components—Final (50%), Midterm (40%), and Attendance (10%), with an optional economics writing requirement (5%) that scales down the weight of the other components. This means that your grade is heavily dependent on the midterm and final exams. Given that the material on the midterm is independent of the final, it’s crucial to perform well on both. The exams are mostly focused on memorizing readings and lecture material, so taking detailed notes is essential. The slides, while useful, are minimalistic (black text on a white background); be sure to supplement them with your own notes. Additionally, the slides from section meetings aren’t always posted, so it’s important to stay engaged and attentive during those discussions.As for Professor Miron’s teaching, while his libertarian perspective is thought–provoking and much of it makes sense, some of his arguments can come across as radical. At times, he would claim that those who disagreed with his views lacked strong evidence, referencing studies that weren’t always persuasive. With that being said, this aspect of the course is always an opportunity for intellectual engagement, as you can agree with or challenge his points and ask questions to explore your viewpoints. The freedom to share your opinions and dig deeper into the material is one of the most valuable aspects of the class, allowing you to form your own perspective on the libertarian arguments presented.",0.9961,"exam is tough, please study ahead for it and know the assignments, the prep isn't the best, tricky questions, best to know each reading well as the do matter",-0.5093,,0.0,A Libertarian Perspective on Economic and Social Policy,ECON 1017,Jeffrey A.

In the first section of this review, I will discuss the first half of the class. In the second section, I discuss the second half. Finally, I conclude and suggest avenues for future exploration.First half: David L. is such a good professor! He is so nice and really cares about everyone. The material can be a bit dry at time since the first half is really about methods, getting you familiar with dynamic program, Bellman equation, stochastic processes, etc, but he is a very engaging lecturer.  He's done this class forever, so lectures are incredibly efficient at getting you to know what you need to know and understand it at a deep level. HWs could be a bit long but nothing too egregious; very clear and relevant questions. He also uploads solutions a day in advance so that if you get stuck, you aren't stuck forever and can get a little hint. Midterm was incredibly fair, maybe a tad on the easier side. Second half: David L. is pretty funny and seems like a great guy, but not always the best professor. Lectures tended to run over time and we wouldn't finish all the content in models, so he made it so that sections covered new content that wasn't taught in class. Homework assignments were not clearly worded and took a very long time to complete. The midterm was also confusingly worded and on the long side for the amount of algebra required. It was also a bit strange when he pointed at an Asian student on the first day and asked if he was from Japan to make a point about economic growth across countries (the student was of Chinese origin). His research is incredibly interesting though, and his macrodevelopment class next semester sounds exciting.Takeaways: This is a required class for the PhD sequence so there is not much choice there (unless you are an undergraduate, of which there were several in this class; not sure if this class is the best choice for undergraduates since 2010A is probably a much stronger signal unless you plan on taking 2010D in the spring). David Laibson is excellent. The second half will likely change next year since David Lagakos was a visiting professor; even if he is teaching it next time, I'm sure it'll be more polished the second time around.

In fact, it marks the largest growth period in human development outside of infancy. Driven by enhanced thinking and reasoning capabilities, adolescents struggle with balancing their desires for autonomy andindependence with their desires for guidance and connection. These dynamics result in renegotiating family and social relationships and engagement in school, impact the effectiveness of educational practices, and enhance adolescents' ability to think and plan for their future. This course is designed to provide a practical understanding of the developmental issues, assets, and trajectories of adolescent thinking and reasoning. Based in classic and current theory and research and using real problems of practice, students will learn, integrate, and apply knowledge of biological and cognitive development and of identity processes. This course will prepare educational practitioners to integrate developmental approaches to their pedagogy and provide a foundation for those interested in applied research on adolescence.No prerequisites; prior course work in developmental psychology is helpful, but the course is designed for students without a psychology background.

ES51 FTW! But definitely a huge time commitment!!Hi! If you're deciding whether to take ES51 or not, the question is simple: major/requirement–wise, do you need to take it? – If so, take it as soon as possible! The skills learned in the course are so useful no matter what career you choose! I'm glad I took it in my Freshman Fall because I now feel much more prepared and certain about following a career in Mechanical Engineering.– If not: are you willing to take the challenge? This class is a HUGE time commitment, and it is really not worth it if you won't be able to put in the effort. If you decide to take it: this class is worth every single atom of dedication you can offer. Seymur is not a particularly good lecturer, but he is probably the sweetest person in John A. Paulson and he makes a real effort to get to know his students individually. He always stays after class taking any questions you might have, either about the content or about a career in Engineering. It's clearly that he loves his students! Class and lab often didn't have a very clear connection, but lab was so cool! I learned so much. If you can, stay in the lab after hours, and take your time to really explore all the resources available to you. This class is not only an intro to Mechanical Engineering, but also a wonderful intro to Engineering at Harvard as a whole and the resources at the SEC. Don't come into this class with a mindset to do the bare minimum – the more you put in, the more you take away. Befriend your TFs and understand that there is truly a lot of help to help you navigate ES51.

Stephanie's teaching style may not be one that works for everyone––it's a little unorthodox and she does sometimes ramble––but it really worked well for me. It was clear that she is incredibly passionate both about what she was teaching and about her students and their well–being, even to the point of buying the whole 30+ person lecture cookies/donuts multiple times during the semester. She was also very knowledgeable, particularly about genres and technical elements. She and both TFs were both very available through office hours and email, and you would earn extra points for seeking feedback from them before turning in an assignment. She was definitely a stricter grader than my TF, but both left detailed feedback and grades that I thought were reasonable. Stephanie graded 4 out of 5 assignments, and I could tell she was getting to know us as writers/matching our writing to our contributions to class discussions as the semester went on.Structure–wise, I really liked that the class defined literature as ""anything with words,"" because it meant that we got to study music and film/TV as well as poetry and novels and plays. Stephanie also made an effort to represent different types of voices/characters in what we read, which I appreciated, and she asked for our preferences towards the end of the semester, which meant that we got to watch Fleabag and analyze it! The reading was reasonable (up to a short book per week, but usually a dozen poems or a short play or a couple of songs), and our TFs worked to make all readings available for free (!!) through the library so that we didn't have to buy everything being taught ourselves. Stephanie also seemed to have connections to everyone and was able to set up Zooms/in–person visits from something like 60–70% of all of the authors/creators we studied, including Dessa, Monica Yoon, and Danez Smith. It was so so cool to be able to meet the creators of what we were studying and ask them questions about their work/life as a professional artist. In terms of assignments, you could choose from 20 creative and 20 analytical prompts, and the class encouraged you to take risks by dropping your lowest creative assignment grade at the end of the semester. I also appreciated the built–in peer workshops and opportunities for discussion in section. Both Manan and Imani were incredible and so so knowledgeable about what we were studying!I wouldn't say that this class was easy, and I definitely had to work hard (especially on my written assignments), but I found it to be really rewarding and enjoyable.

However, I found the format of the course a bit challenging—it's a mix between a lecture and a seminar, which didn’t really work for me. For a seminar, the class size was quite large, so contributing often felt intimidating—like giving a speech with 20 people around the table. I would have preferred a more traditional lecture format or a smaller seminar setting. Additionally, while it was wonderful to hear everyone’s scattered thoughts, the discussions tended to feel unstructured. If you’re hoping for a focused exploration of consciousness or a clear thematic thread, you might find it harder to extract cohesive ideas, as our discussions often revolved around whatever we found interesting in the books. Additionally, the grading relies on two essays without rubrics or structured prompts—you have the freedom to write on any topic, but this can feel risky if you’re concerned about your GPA.

We will discover that as the novelistic treatment of consciousness changes, so the idea of what a mind (or a self) is, also changes: the form (the means of representation) modifies the content (what is represented).

They made the continent theirs millennia prior. And yet, Indigenous Americans are often missing, or misrepresented—in traditional, even contemporary portraits of North America. An introduction to the study of Native North America—and Native American and Indigenous Studies—this course provides a sweeping portrait of the histories and legacies of settler colonialism, war, dispossession, and slavery in the continent; it also reckons with contemporary issues, like reparations and the LandBack movement. Whenever possible, a global perspective will illuminate aspects of settler colonial states in places such as Australia, Finland, and Japan. More than anything, this sort of perspective will bring into view the magnitude of Indigenous power, resilience, and solidarity. Specific subjects of study include: land loss; Native culture and spirituality; inter-cultural and inter-ethnic relations; human-nature interactions; U.S. land management practices, including resource extraction; Indian law and legal violence; sovereignty and self-determination; decolonization and reparations; gender equity and human rights.

I came into Harvard having done some essay writing before and got great marks and good grades in my writing, so I was initially hesitant in taking EXPOS 10 and not 20. What made me reconsider, though, was the writing placement test where I found myself a little confused and unfamiliar with the types of writing that appeared on the test. The writing test is genuinely a fantastic indicator as to which class you are suited for! You then have a call with an expos advisor, and mine told me that they could tell from my test that my writing instincts were super strong! But, they could see that I was slightly unfamiliar with the form of writing present, hence I took EXPOS 10 and I have NO regrets. Super thankful I took this class. EXPOS 10 has a very steady pace, very generous assignments and deadlines, and overall will NOT cause you much stress in freshman fall. Believe me,  from everyone around me and my own experience, most people will opt for all the harder classes in freshman fall thinking they will be super fine and then will suffer massively trying to navigate such hard classes in a new environment bringing many new and difficult challenges. This class was genuinely the best part of my week. Relaxing and super educational and informative. I left with a vastly better competency to write and learnt SO much about my own writing style and it's strengths, weaknesses and how I can improve in the future and in EXPOS 20. Writing is an invaluable skill! Making the decision to take things slowly and complete 2 semesters of writing instead of 1 (as a future CS concentrator by the way!) in order to have super strong foundations and competency in writing is genuinely the best decision I have made here. My instructor, Jonah Johnson, is also singlehandedly one of the greatest humans I have ever met. He is an incredible instructor: extremely knowledgeable and wise; incredibly friendly and fosters the creation of a very comfortable environment; and extremely understanding and kind if you ever have ANY struggles during the course. He is absolutely dedicated to making EXPOS 10 the most positive, productive and non–pressuring/scary learning experience possible for every individual in the class.

Following Expos Studio 10, students take either Expos Studio 20 or an Expos 20 course to meet the writing requirement. All students meet with an Expos faculty member to discuss their course placement before enrolling.","After taking Expos Studio 10, a student must pass Expository Writing 20 or Expos Studio 20 to meet the College's Expository Writing requirement.",Faculty of Arts & Sciences,4,Not Available for Cross Registration,Expository Writing,Seminar,,FAS Letter Graded,,,,None

That being said, it does lean very heavily into the world of anthropology (specifically concerning the world of African witchcraft, though you will explore this topic in other cultures also). Expect to do a decent amount of reading. Some of the readings can be a little dense, long, and hard to understand, but many of them are also very enjoyable. Bafford really helps you out with the paper–writing process. He is very understanding and helps nudge along your ideas. If you want to get stronger as a writer and feel interested in this topic, then I highly recommend taking this course. Honestly, when choosing an Expos course, choose one that really interests you despite the workload. It is so much easier to write a good paper on something that interests you than to just write a paper on a topic you think will be simple and easy to write about. Trust me, it sounds counterintuitive but it works. It's why I found writing for this class great. I liked the essay prompts we were given, and even now, as I am in the middle of writing my final research paper, I am enjoying the writing process (despite how worried I feel about it, haha).

Taboo wasn’t my first choice for the Expos lottery but I’m so glad that I ended up in it! I think that to succeed in an Expos class, you must be a little interested in the material (you don’t have to be overly passionate about it) and jive well with your professor. For example, I don’t feel strongly about cultural taboos but I found them interesting enough to be able to come up with essays that genuinely excited me. It definitely helped that Doug was super flexible with our essay topics; he gave us a LOT of creative freedom with our essays. Doug is also very, very understanding about extensions and conscious about our workloads outside of Expos. His policy on extensions (I’m not sure if this is standard across other Expos courses) was essentially “no questions asked.” He gave us 168 hours of free extension time to use across the semester and at the end of the semester, expressed that if we needed more time beyond that, we could have it. I rarely asked for extensions in high school but I ended up using all of my free extension time. When he assigned longer readings, he never expected us to throughly read them (he told us skimming was ok) which was also very nice.Lastly, this may have been specific to the cohort of people in my class but I genuinely looked forward to class every Tuesday/Thursday because of the people. Doug’s ice breakers at the start of every class definitely bonded us and by the end of the semester, we were all pretty close. Our closeness made for a very fun classroom environment and now that I think about it, I don’t think that I ever dreaded going to this Expos class.

Looking at it objectively, I think the class was great and deeply improved my writing. Additionally, the topic of magical realism was super interesting, providing for super in–depth and creative analysis. If you really enjoy literary analysis and argumentation, then this class is great for you. The readings are super interesting, relatively short in length, and really digestible, and you even get to watch two movies as part of the class, all provided for free. Overall, I loved the topic, and I think it is one of the most interesting expos topics out there. The class also creates a really collaborative environment through small–group and whole–class discussions in class.The class itself was taught really well and engagingly, and Dr. Brown is super supportive. He is great and you can tell that he really, deeply cares about the students and their growth as writers. His feedback is great, but in the nature of preparing arguments regarding Magical Realism, it can often take some time before you and Dr. Brown fully understand what each other are talking about during conferences. So, just make sure you are well–prepared to concisely explain your questions and thesis if you want to make the most out of conferences with him, as they can be extremely constructive if properly prepared for. However, one piece of advice that I wish I had prior to taking the class ––– during the final project season, if an assignment is vague, great! It means you can take some liberties with how you complete it. Don't stress too much about how exactly it should be done, because Dr. Brown probably wanted you to have freedom in completing it the way that best suited you and your argument.However, in the context of this class being one of many expos options, I would like to point out a few things. Firstly, this class is pretty fast–paced compared to some other expos. I often found myself completing final drafts while my friends in other expos courses were working on first drafts. While this may be annoying in the middle of the semester, it becomes pretty nice during the time for working on the final paper, as we end up having much more time to flesh out our papers than other students in other, slower–paced expos courses do. Secondly, I will say that this class is very well–tailored to analytical essays, which makes it slightly less applicable to other areas of life. While it is great at preparing you to use online databases and do research and is generally great for improving writing and argumentation skills, it is very tailored to the analysis of magical realism, which may make it hard to apply this course elsewhere.Overall, I think this class was super useful in improving my writing skills, and Dr. Brown was incredibly supportive along the way. The class was a bit fast–paced in the middle, and did require a lot more work than some other expos courses. However, I got a lot out of the class and really enjoyed writing the final paper. At the end of the day, I think the class was an overall positive experience, and I would generally encourage anyone to take this class if they are interested in the topic, enjoy writing literary analysis articles, and are willing to put in the extra work.",0.9993,DO NOT TAKE THIS EXPOS especially if you are a STEM student.

THIS IS WORK. To all upcoming expos takers know that this class is not a walk in the park. To start off, the discussions had in class were really amazing. Maybe its the nature of the course or just that everyone who takes it is cracked, but literary analysis and discussion in this class consistently happened at an engaging and high level that mirrored a sort of intellectualism found in the salons of the Enlightenment age. Overall this alone made the class very enjoyable, and the readings and assignments made sense and were fun, especially for a certain subset of people. That certain subset being people who REALLY like literature/humanities. This classes greatest asset is also my greatest worry in recommending it to other people. If you already have a stacked schedule, I would not recommend this Expos class as an easy edition. Your writing will definitely be held to higher standards and expectations than reports I have heard from many other Expos students in my year. Writing at a Hum10/very sophisticated level is encouraged and at points expected, and looking between the fine lines into ways to write on topics that could be dissertations with a constraint of 8 pages is a challenge you will face. Gauvreau is a very nice professor and easy to talk to. No real complaints there. He gives really good feedback to expand your argument, however I feel that sometimes he may encourage too much out of us. Useful for brainstorming but at times it was hard to incorporate into my 6 page draft. Overall, if you are a STEM–y minded person taking Phys 16 and Math 55 as well, I would avoid taking this expos as it's literally a version of Hum10 where you do not have to read a book every week (with the added bonus of watching a 3 hour movie in Japanese in 2 days (it was good tho ngl)).

Dr Pietras has high expectations for the three papers (which most Expos classes have, too), though it is not overly difficult. There are both easier and more difficult expos classes (in my opinion). Despite this, I would recommend this course as the topic (Queer Coming of Age Stories) made the class more enjoyable. All the media we analyzed had more of a personal connection. Understand that this is not a class about your own queer narrative, though (if you are queer). This is an analytical class that looks at novels and films consisting of queer characters. For me, this was a relief as someone was still discovering their own identity. The topic also fosters as strong community, so you can expect to meet some phenomenal classmates. This makes class discussions way more enjoyable as we had inside jokes and goofy moments. Dr. Pietras also did a great job leading class discussions, keeping us on pace, and offering assistance during office hours and over email. Personally, I feel like my writing has improved in this class. If you take it, though, please don't procrastinate the papers until the day of. It makes life truly miserable... this is true for any Expos class. Overall: I would recommend as Expos is mandatory (plus the topic is fun for this course).

She was super accommodating when people were sick or needed extensions or anything of the sort. Overall, this class was much easier than most of my friends' Expos. The final paper, being a capstone project, also came in quite handy during finals season.Some cons of this class: the reading was super heavy at the beginning (upwards of 200+ pages in two days), and it was challenging for me to learn how to read efficiently as someone who didn't have a lot of long, academic reading experience in high school. Additionally, with the pro of it being a relatively easy class, there was the negative that it didn't push me to become a better writer.

HOWEVER, don't let this deter you from taking this class either. At least this semester, we visited the Art Museum, and the Collection of Scientific Instruments, and the Learning Lab, which were all really interesting (and I haven't seen a lot of other expos classes do this). I think the best part was the guest speakers that came in––everything that they would talk about would relate directly to the essay you had to write for the unit, so it helped in that aspect, but the topics they would talk about would also just be so engaging and mind–opening, and you would learn a lot of things that you would not be able to in other classes!For the first two essays, there are a lot of readings, but this also forces you to internalize the most important parts of the readings and really grasp the speaker's purpose, which helps you set up your arguments for your essays. The amount of readings greatly decreases after the first two months after you move into the Capstone project, and this Capstone project (at least for this class this year) builds off your second essay. I would say that the topics this class touches on are pretty niche and in my opinion, very interesting to talk about––the ethics behind scientific communication, the balance between scientific objectivity and audience relevance, the difficulty of bridging value systems in crisis communications. In fact, I think if you are a STEM concentrator thinking of going into research, this expos really sets you up well for stuff you will face in the future. However, besides the first essay, which I overall had fun writing just because it concerned Hubble Space Telescope images, these topics are pretty painful to write about. It definitely requires a lot of thinking, drafting/redrafting, and revisions just so you can continue to keep your writing clear but also contain the nuance that this class requires/Professor Raymer is looking for. Professor Raymer really emphasizes including some kind of nuance into your argument for all your essays––your thesis needs to address the question/essay prompt but there is often an additional thing she is looking for, such as scope or application. One thing I wish I did more of this semester if I had the time was go up to her after class (or during her office hours) to talk about my essays outside of the designated feedback time––Professor Raymer really goes out of her way to look and give suggestions on specific questions you have about your writing, and she is also pretty lenient on extensions! You will be able to get more constructive feedback on your essay. Overall, I had fun in this class––it definitely isn't ideal when you have an essay on a relatively hard topic to tackle and a midterm in the same week, but everybody in the class was so smart and fun to talk to, and I made some really good friends, so it made up for it!

Throughout the course, there are smaller, low–stress assignments that guide you step–by–step toward completing the main essays, which makes the workload manageable and helps you stay on track.There isn’t a heavy reading load, which is a plus, and Jane is very understanding when it comes to deadlines. She’s also approachable and helpful during office hours, making it easy to get the support you need. The course material is modern and thought–provoking, which makes it both relevant and exciting to learn about. If you are interested in AI (even without any technical background) this is a very good way to fulfill your writing requirement.

And added bonus, taking expos with mostly stem concentrators is a major hack because no one really liked writing so the standards were definitely lower.

That being said, I did write essays but they were non–academic. Coming into Expos 20 was something I enjoyed, but didn't find too challenging because I enjoy writing. I think Dr Sweeney had a forgiving syllabus planned out that contributed to why it wasn't too challenging, but still provided something I had to struggle a little with. TAKE THIS COURSE IF:1. You enjoy sentimental fiction! As a new course, this is effectively what sold me on this Expos. I enjoy sentimental books and films – and if you like romcoms! we analyse one at the end of the class. I think being someone who genuinely appreciates this type of literature just guarantees you'll enjoy the course a lot more. 2. Our readings were: Uncle Tom's Cabin, then 3 films – Philadelphia, Fruitvale Station, and You've Got Mail.  My 9am section watched these films together and had a cute little watch party, so recommend to repeat! 3. You want lots of feedback on your papers – Dr Sweeney gives great feedback, and lots of it! 4. You want a meaningful struggle for your Expos experience – this class is by no means ""easy"" — you've got to do the readings, read them closely, and engage in class online and offline. This is good flexibility for those who feel nervous about in–class participation. Our Unit 3 essay requires a lot of research too, so it's something you need to want to do and own the process. But I never felt like we had busy work, or work that wouldn't be helpful in some way.The most helpful activities in this class were (1) the workshops where we all read 1–2 peoples' essays and gave feedback on it, and having my essay chosen for the workshop and experiencing both being the person giving and receiving feedback was a good experience. I got to ask many people how to fix things I thought were problems, and really get solutions. Shoutout to my classmates for being amazing people too and giving good feedback <3 I also thought that the Perusall comments on each other's essay was a great way of getting very specific feedback, and it helped me identify problems in my essay I wouldn't have thought of resolving otherwise. (2) is the model essay review e.g. in Unit 1 we looked at another essay about the Great Gatsby, and in Unit 3 we compared and contrasted academic papers' introductions. I think this was helpful for building a sense of ""what good looks like"" so we had something to work towards. Being able to read my classmates' papers also provided a sense of what I'm doing, and made my work feel less in a vacuum where I don't know how good or bad it is. READINGS: I thought the progression of readings for this course was relatively well organised. Unit 1 started out a little lighter and shorter with the excerpt from Fisher's essay, which was genuinely really interesting and a text we could have discussions about. Applying it to Obama's speeches was something I did not expect, but I think that made it a good example of a lens essay, and taught me that I could indeed use seemingly 'unrelated' lenses in my writing, helping me see connections maybe I otherwise wouldn't have. The amount of reading was in the ballpark of 20~ pages per week plus analysis. The fact that Fisher's work related to our Unit 2 readings of Uncle Tom's Cabin was also a strategic choice, I think it primed me to read the novel through a more sentimental lens. Reading the whole novel on such a short timeline and with the level of attention required was indeed challenging, but it was made a bit easier since we only had to close–read specific chapters. I really appreciated that caveat; and it made the workload a bit more manageable. At most, this was ~100+ pages per week. Unit 2 was pretty intense reading–wise, because we had the novel, and also two lengthy academic papers to read. Brodhead and Noble's essays, I will say, were stimulating. Reading the whole novel also gave me adequate authority to write on our topic, and I think the library trip also provided more context and nuance which made me feel more knowledgeable about refuting claims made by Brodhead or Noble. Whilst it was a LOT to read and review, I'm not sure I would change anything about them. Unit 3 had recommended readings for the films we watched, and I think they were also useful. So... great job Dr Sweeney! I can't think of any readings that weren't very useful or didn't challenge my thinking about our source material. Generally, no changes I'd suggest to Dr Sweeney except to maintain the workshops, and the segment where he picked out good/bad sentences or grammatical errors to share from all the drafts helped too!I think with Unit 3, some of the class segments on plagiarism and citations could have been shortened a little and replaced with more time picking apart each others' papers or even other academic essays. I liked the excercise we did ranking the different academic papers' use of sources, and analytical question.",0.9995,,0.0,,0.0,Expository Writing 20,EXPOS   20 201,Sheza Alqera,2025 Fall,Full Term,2025-09-02,2025-12-03,10:30am,11:45am,Tue Thu,13031,Department,0/15,0,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,"An intensive seminar that aims to improve each student’s ability to discover and reason about evidence through the medium of essays.

I like philosophy of language and of meaning, and as a result the chance to read Frege, Wittgenstein, Grice, Putnam etc. was a wonderful opportunity, and we really got to get into the texts in question. Professor Willison very clearly knows what he's talking about with regards to these texts and it was really wonderful gaining a greater appreciation of them. I also felt that the workload of the course was very reasonable, with it consisting mostly of reading responses to each of the readings to hold us to account on the readings and then structured work on the three essays. The classes themselves are mostly very engaging, with a lot of student led discussion (although sometimes so much that it felt a bit unguided, but this was not often that big an issue).  One thing I will warn however: if you don't have an interest in philosophy of meaning, the readings can get very dense at times and at those times it is very hard to stay motivated unless you have an active interest in the material, so if you do not enjoy philosophy – especially if you don't like things that don't seem to have immediate practical relevance to the real world in some sense – then the course might not be as interesting for you. I still think that Professor Willison does a good job of making it interesting and giving you reason to care, but if that's not your area of interest I don't think it makes too much sense to place this that high up on the expos lottery,",0.9812,"I would strongly advise you against taking this course. Unless you absolutely love philosophy and are ready for grad level readings, you probably won't enjoy this class (even if you are a philosophy lover you still might not enjoy this class because it is poorly organized)I think the material of this course was so challenging that it felt extremely difficult to really grow as a writer. Expos is meant to be a writing class taught through the vehicle of some other field. In this class however, the philosophy is the focus. I could see this class being a philosophy course for philosophy concentrators, not an expos class. He told us on the first day that this class would cover grad level material, which again does not make sense considering this is an introductory writing class.Additionally the lack of quality feedback and difficulty communicating with the professor made it extremely difficult to find direction in the course and grow as a writer (his feedback was usually incredibly vague, and he rarely replied to emails).On top of everything else, things were incredibly poorly organized.

It would have been nice to have more notice. The class was so disorganized.– I actually didn't find Nick's feedback helpful. He would tell us to do things like work on our footwork, but he never explained what good footwork looked like. I also often disagreed with what he told my classmates about their speeches, so I didn't necessarily put so much stock in his comments.– I didn't find the exercises we did in between our speeches (like the improv speeches) useful.

You get to go to the forest, stay in a really nice house, and bond with 9 other students for a whole weekend, three times throughout the semester. These weekends served as extremely nice and relaxing breaks from the rest of the semester, and I still got a lot of work done for other classes at night while there. The group was great and had some of the nicest people I've met on campus, and since you will all share similar interests if you are in this class, there are endless things to talk about with the group. I personally found some great friends in the class, people who I will hopefully stay close with throughout the rest of my 4 years at Harvard. Additionally, as for the class itself, it was the best learning environment I have ever seen in a class. It provided an extremely immersive learning environment where we were enabled not only to be much more interested in what we learned, but we could have a dialogue about each topic and ask further questions about things that were not necessarily pointed out to us, since we were in an immersive environment where our own observations were appreciated and adapted into the fluently shifting yet curriculum–based conversations. We got to see real, clear evidence of global change, learn why and how it happened, and how it can be mitigated or better understood through experiments that were occurring. The content was super interesting and I had some great conversations with Dave and the rest of the class about climate change and just anything that came up in conversation. It really helped me to see that there absolutely is a lot we can do about climate change, and inspired me even more to pursue research in my future.

I think this course is great for those who even have a slight interest in these fields, but I will say, that this course made me realize that I am not interested in humanities. Although the surgical aspects were interesting, I felt uninterested in many of the readings, especially the earlier ones. If you're not interested in humanities or history at all, I wouldn't recommend this course, but if you are, and are considering pre–med or simply have an interest in medicine, I definitely would recommend this seminar. Most of the readings aren't bad, but some can be like 20+ pages. I don't recommend skipping out on the readings as without reading, you won't be able to participate in discussion and it feels so awkward while a few of the students who actually did the reading are speaking and engaging in discussion with the professor while you are silent and don't have anything to add. I do recommend skimming most of the readings, especially if they're long. As long as you have a general idea of the subjects, you'll be able to add to the discussion, so skimming is fine in my personal opinion. I know other students who went overboard and read everything and took notes, but I didn't do all of that and was still able to participate. I would say try to do the readings a day or two before class so you don't forget the topics on the day of class. You can also take notes during the readings, but I didn't. The papers are not bad (the first one is a 5–paragraph essay and the second is a 3–5 page double–spaced essay + presentation) and Dr. Milham provides useful feedback on your writing.

What diagnoses were they making? What treatments did they offer? How did they understand human anatomy and physiology?   A millennium later, the Hippocratic physicians emerged on the Aegean Island of Cos.  These physicians left us carefully stated surgical principles based, at least partly, on observation and measurement.  Why did they record their wisdom in the form of aphorisms? At around the same time, Shushruta, in what is now India, appears to have offered surprisingly modern surgical care to his patients.  Who was he?   In the second century CE Galen of Pergamum bursts on to the scene, intending to restore Hippocratic orthodoxy. Why was surgical thinking for nearly two millennia dominated by this his, often erroneous, teaching?  The Islamic Golden Age, an explosion of scientific and medical discovery, is a key to our understanding of all that follows in surgical history.  Why is this period overlooked today? How did the exposure of Galen’s anatomical imprecision by Vesalius in 1543 and his absurd physiology by Harvey in 1628 begin a Medical Enlightenment?  Why did it take until the 19th century for surgeons solve the riddles of anesthesia and antisepsis?   What were the roles of surgeons in the Eugenics movement and the Holocaust?  Is the advice of the Hippocratic physicians that “To understand surgery one must go to war” true in the 21st Century?Our study will examine these questions and many more.  We will visit the site of the first use of ether anesthesia and explore the human body in the anatomy lab at Harvard Medical School.

Is the classification of a person as dead a moral judgment, or is it an entirely scientific matter? Is death a misfortune to the person who dies? How can death be a misfortune if you are no longer around to experience that misfortune? Is it possible to survive after death? What does it mean for you to survive after your death? Is there such a thing as an immaterial soul distinct from your body? Is immortality something you should want in the first place?

This is the most transformative and enlightening academic experience I have ever had, and I doubt that it can be surpassed (though I wholeheartedly hope that it will). I cannot recommend this class enough. I mean it. I do not know how to convey just how much I loved this course. I cannot be more grateful to have ended up in this class – it's the best thing that has happened to me academically and I will do my best to convey why it is such a special course.Complexity realizes the full potential of what a First Year Seminar can be. A First–Year Seminar is a pass/fail course, which means that you should treat the course as if the grade was completely irrelevant. For some, it may mean that you can put in a minimal amount of work to get by. If this is what you expect, you should consider another course. Not having a lettered grading scale offers the opportunity for you to learn for the sake of learning: there is no upper limit to how much work you can put into this course. There is no assurance of ""having done enough"" that an ""A"" offers. This is a class where how much you put in is how much you get out of it. I mean this in the best sense possible – as long as you are willing to put in the work, there is simply no limit to the amount of intellectual gratification you can get out of this course. That's why I appreciated this course so much. I spent an average of ten hours per week on this course; it is my biggest time commitment of the term. I can say that every single ounce of effort I put into it was worth it. My point is that you should take this course if and only if: 1) you are passionate about the content, 2) you are willing to learn for the sake of learning, and 3) you are willing to put a lot of work into it because you enjoy learning.What makes Professor Fisher and Complexity phenomenal is his willingness to treat you as an intellectual equal and his care. From the very first week of class, the guiding questions were complex and they never stopped being complex. One can build a course based on the questions listed in each week's handout alone. Professor Fisher does not dumb down the content so that you can understand; he presents Hamlet and Ulysses in their full complexity and thereby illustrates their greatness and their full interpretative potential. Each weekly lecture was the highlight of my week. Professor Fisher cares a lot about the content, and he gets you to care, too. I would always walk away feeling ineffably inspired, even if I had spent the night before writing my response paper until 5 AM. The lectures were so engaging and for the lack of a better term, so, so, so intellectually stimulating. It is truly a privilege to be able to take this course, and knowing that this course has ended makes me feel very sad.Professor Fisher also provides very helpful feedback on your weekly response papers. His detailed annotation of my weekly response papers motivated me to push myself to write better and gave me the critical perspective I needed to do so. That alone makes taking the course worth it. Furthermore, I have also gained so many invaluable insights into literature and into what I want to do with my undergraduate years from talking to him during his office hours. Again, I cannot overstate my appreciation.As a cherry on top, you will also be reading Hamlet and Ulysses, some of the greatest works of art ever created. I had no idea what Ulysses was before I started and I will never regret reading it. But if I hadn't read it with the guidance of this course, I do not think I would have been able to get nearly as much out of it as I did; Ulysses is, as Professor Fisher says, a scholarly book that is best read in an academic setting. If anything I said resonates with what you want academically, you should take this class.",0.9953,,0.0,,0.0,Complexity in Works of Art: Ulysses and Hamlet,FYSEMR   33X,Philip Fisher,2025 Fall,Full Term,2025-09-02,2025-12-03,9:45am,11:45am,Wed,13964,Instructor,0/12,0,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,"Is the complexity, the imperfection, the difficulty of interpretation, the unresolved meaning found in certain great and lasting works of literary art a result of technical experimentation?  Or is the source extreme complexity—psychological, metaphysical, or spiritual?  Does it result from limits within language, or from language’s fit to thought and perception?  Do the inherited forms found in literature permit only certain variations within experience to reach lucidity?  Is there a distinction in literature between what can be said and what can be read?  The members of the seminar will investigate the limits literature faces in giving an account of mind, everyday experience, thought, memory, full character, and situation in time.  The seminar will make use of a classic case of difficulty, Shakespeare’s Hamlet, and a modern work of unusual complexity and resistance to both interpretation and to simple comfortable reading, Joyce’s Ulysses.  Reading in exhaustive depth these two works will suggest the range of meanings for terms like complexity, resistance, openness of meaning, and experimentation within form.",,Faculty of Arts & Sciences,4,Not Available for Cross Registration,First Year Seminar Program,Seminar,,FAS Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory,Course open to Freshman Students Only,,,None

Genes provide the basic blueprint for brain architecture, but experiences shape the activity of the genome and thus determine how the circuitry is wired. Significant adversity can derail developmental processes and distort brain maturation, leading to limited economic and social mobility. Exposure to significant adversity early in life, particularly during critical periods of brain development, may increase risk for a host of chronic physical health problems, including cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, and addictive behavior; it can also lead to a variety of mental health problems, including depression and anxiety and characterological problems. Science clearly indicates that the longer we wait to intervene on behalf of such children, the more difficult it becomes to achieve healthy outcomes. This constraint is particularly true for children who sustain the wear and tear of early exposure to so‐called “toxic stress”. In this seminar we will critically examine the range of adverse early experiences that impact children growing up in both low and high resource countries. Key themes include a) the nature of the adversity children are exposed to, b) the timing of the adversity c) the chronicity of the adversity, and d) individual differences (including genetic and environmental factors that may confer protection on children exposed to early adversity).

We will approach these issues through a variety of student-led presentations, mock clinical interviews, written critiques, and class debates.Early in the semester, the class will take a trip to Dr. Arnett’s laboratory at Boston Children’s Hospital to see a demonstration of how electroencephalography (EEG) is used to measure brain activity in children with ADHD.

It has radically altered modes of interpersonal engagement, democratized access to tools of mass communication, and changed the role of gatekeepers that traditionally controlled access to music, video, and other media. Given the breadth of its impact, it is not surprising that the Internet has pushed the bounds of legal doctrines that govern speech, privacy, and the creation and exploitation of content. Mass-scale online distribution of copyrighted works tests the limits of legal doctrines developed in an era of physical copies. Age-old tensions between privacy and the right to free expression have been exacerbated in cases where one’s right to speak bumps up against the desire of another to keep information private. And, the ability to share—and, thus, to consume—extraordinary amounts of personal data has impacted government (which collects and uses data for purposes of law enforcement) and private companies (which collect and use data for purposes of advertising and monetization). This seminar will provide an overview of legal doctrines that govern the online conduct of individuals and institutional actors. It will address the rights and responsibilities of the intermediaries that mediate many of our online activities – social networks, cloud-based storage services, email providers, and the like. Students will consider old and new legal frameworks and the ways in which the law informs strategic decisions for those that operate online. The seminar will address some of the most important and complex policy debates of our day—regarding the proper scope of intellectual property protection; the balance between  a robust environment for online free expression and a desire to protect against harmful speech; and the ways in which the law addresses privacy vis-à-vis both government and private actors.

The transition from adolescence to adulthood is often fraught with anxieties about realizing one’s dreams, getting into college, succeeding in the job market, and finding a life partner. Have the definitions and markers of adulthood changed across generations?  Should these conceptualizations change or adapt to the times? Are young people today trapped in an extended adolescence? Some experts and the popular press contend that young people today are coddled and more resistant to growing up than were those who came of age a generation or more ago. Conversely, other experts and many young adults today find that growing up is harder—harder to launch a career, burdened by student loan debt, harder to find a compatible life partner—in general, harder to achieve the life their parents have. Amid these debates, it is unclear what is meant by adulthood and whether it can or should be defined by the same markers as have been used in the past.  Today’s young adults are charting their own path…or are they? In this seminar, students will define and redefine adulthood based in multiple contexts, considering catalysts and impediments on the pathway to adulthood. Using a historical lens, we will examine and understand the contexts that elicit longer and shorter pathways to adulthood, including the role of the economic context, educational and occupational opportunities, gender, and the need to co-construct adulthood with others.  Whereas societal factors are often considered contextual, this seminar focuses on societies as active agents in shaping adolescents’ beliefs about adulthood and struggling with and sometimes against adolescents as they navigate their place as adults. This seminar takes a global lens and focuses on the ways in which the transition to adulthood is a dynamic and co-constructed concept and will aid students in developing an integrative understanding on societal needs and pressures and young adults’ tools in navigating the path to adulthood.",,Faculty of Arts & Sciences,4,Not Available for Cross Registration,First Year Seminar Program,Seminar,,FAS Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory,,,,None

Democracies are designed with certain mechanisms to generate political accountability.  Re-elections are meant to give voters a tool to reward or punish incumbents for their behavior in office, government oversight agencies like auditing institutions are intended to police politicians from within, and so on. Despite this range of methods for keeping politicians accountable, why is there still so much corruption and impunity within government? Why don’t politicians provide the policies and public services people seem to want?

One only must consider Korea, Vietnam, Bosnia, Afghanistan, and Iraq.This seminar will initially introduce students to some core ideas relating to negotiation and bargaining theory. Through readings, we will then explore how several wars in fact evolved. We will ask why did the war begin, and did the disputants first attempt to avoid armed conflict through negotiations? To what extent, if any, did negotiations between the combatants end the fighting? We will see that while the expectations and aims of the combatants are typically deeply opposed at the beginning of a war, over time they often converge toward an agreement to stop fighting. In such cases, what produces this convergence? To what extent do factors far removed from the battlefield - economic, political, and social – contribute to the success of negotiations?In addition to readings, students will engage in a few negotiations related exercises and simulations in class.",,Faculty of Arts & Sciences,4,Not Available for Cross Registration,First Year Seminar Program,First Year Seminar,,FAS Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory,,,,None

There are a lot of little assignments, but they’re things you can grind out in a couple of minutes, and the quizzes are extremely doable just by skimming through the reading.

For many, the border served (and serves) as a protective barrier from poverty, violence, and, especially, disease. By the early twentieth century many Mexican bodies were perceived as “alien,” “illegal,” and in need of patrolling. Yet these descriptions were also used by Mexican politicians to describe and isolate Indigenous groups and the Chinese within Mexico.

My opinion on this class has absolutely nothing to do with the scholarly capacity and capabilities of Professor Waters and Skocpol. Both are incredible academics and have much to contribute to academia. Also, my TF, Meylin Hauman, was truly unbelievable, and the review below is no reflection of her abilities to effectively teach. She was both kind and accommodating, passionate about her specialties and the course material writ large. I truly wish her the best in her future endeavors in research and teaching.Okay, now for an overview of my points below. My overarching issue with the course is the vast material it tries to cover, the sheer content, and how some of the information presented to us was not done with an underlying thesis or takeaway. I will present my opinions in bullet–point format, addressing both information for prospective students and recommendations for how I would’ve better walked away from the class.– The number of readings: I know they’ve already mentioned to us that they tried to cut it down, but still, it is a lot. Again, I am totally okay with a lot of reading (I’m a social studies concentrator). But this is a Gen Ed and supposed to be, to some degree, at an introductory level. By providing the amount of readings and their length each week (4–6, with many over 20 pages), it was an information overload. It was width, not depth. I only memorized readings for the exams, and I’m sure I’ll forget most by this time next year. Going forward, I would make the following recommendations: keep it to 2 a week or 1 book for two weeks. Each week, the readings could include a twenty– to thirty–page academic paper or journal article followed by a 5–10–page journalistic or media article that offers a countering perspective, nuance, or another angle. This would allow students to really be able to read the material better, more effectively use them on the exams, and actually get into the depth of their corresponding and ongoing conversations in academia. Moreover, the arguments raised could more effectively be incorporated into the lectures. I believe that you can still teach the basics of American society and public policy by going through and weighing arguments and showing how they build them with first principles. And if you’re concerned about students not doing the readings, add a discussion post component that is 100–250 words a week.– Reduce the material covered in lectures: At times, it felt like I was in a high school class being provided a swarm of information on the screen, only for most of it not to be important. For example, when giving context to contemporary issues (while some of the historical information is super interesting), it is overwhelming. Provide just a slide that goes over previous periods and what defined them. I don’t believe there is a need to go over specific laws or specific names of phenomena if you’re not going to test students on it. Going forward, I would make the following recommendations: just cut the excess out of lectures or streamline the information that can be streamlined, incorporate and emphasize the most important “bumper–stickers” of the lesson. Have specific, clear, and detailed learning objectives so that students know exactly what to note down, pay attention to, and, most importantly, study for. For example, “causes of inequality” is not a specific enough learning objective; listing out instead “taxation as a contribution to inequality” or things to that effect. This would help students have a better understanding of what they need to learn (and they will then be able to study and reinforce it, as opposed to searching for it and guessing this is the correct thing they are supposed to be studying and coming to find out it is not even remotely mentioned on an exam).– The ID terms were not clearly identified: A key component of how students are evaluated in this course is their ability to write down and memorize key concepts or terms, like laws or sociological principles. However, students were not provided with a list or sort of reference other than simply materials presented in the lectures. This goes back to point (2): how can a student effectively study and learn if they do not know exactly the basic concepts they are going to be tested on? Put simply, the exam is a game of memorization and anticipated questions, and would it not make the most sense to provide a basic pool of terms and concepts that could be selected? Going forward, I would make the following recommendations: give a list of all the IDs that will be covered in each unit. I don’t think it makes sense to only give the ones out that you would put on the exam, but rather all potential ones. This allows students to both better prepare for the actual exam and also go over and learn material that the professors still think is important for them to walk away with. This would make the objectives and results of the course abundantly clear: what I’m supposed to know and be able to talk about professionally, academically, or in my future research.– No clear academic argument or interpretation: I felt as though the lectures were just a list of random facts at times. While there is most certainly a place for just the brass facts, I think each lecture lacked a clear thesis or walkaway. I would have appreciated it if the professors made an academic argument while providing essential information. In this process, they can and should engage and explain other perspectives, but I take a class to get two things: (a) new information and (b) a scholar's interpretation of that information. Now, I can still come to my own conclusions, but at least I am aware of how academics in the field are thinking about the topic and understand the evidence or information they’re using to come to these conclusions. Going forward, I would make the following recommendations: think about the overarching argument I am giving in the lecture, how I can present the basic concepts, information, or background information essential to understanding the debate, and highlight other scholars' opinions and analysis.Overall, while this course benefits from exceptional instructors, passionate teaching, and a wealth of valuable content, its effectiveness is hindered by an overwhelming breadth of material, unclear learning objectives, and a lack of cohesive academic arguments. By streamlining the readings, focusing lectures on key takeaways, providing clear ID terms, and emphasizing overarching theses, the course could better balance depth with accessibility.

Professor Sunstein is a truly remarkable person with a remarkable career and life experiences – it was really cool to have him as a lecturer. He is genuinely invested in the students and the content he is teaching.  I think everyone should take this course because it really opens your mind up about how people think – both the logistics and practical nuances as well as more philosophical and personal nuances – which is really important in today's polarized political environment. I genuinely learnt quite a lot about topics and issues I thought I had a good grasp of but that I actually had a pretty one–dimensional view of. The readings were interesting but I highly encourage going to lecture (which is just once a week) and actually paying attention to Professor Sunstein, rather than being on your laptop or doing other work, because his lectures give you a much better understanding of topics and also helps you remember things that you might need to know for the final/midterm. Other than the content though, the actual workload is extremely easy to work with – only 4 discussion posts throughout the entire semester – so you essentially don't really have much work to do during the semester, which I think is great, because then you feel better about setting aside the 2 hours to go to lecture and really focus on the content there because that's where I believe most of the learning lies. The only times you really have to put your head down and work is for the midterm and final (also because they constitute a large part of your grade) but the work for this is also doable.

Whether you are a skilled chef or a home-cook, what you do in the kitchen is deeply rooted in science. This class brings together top chefs and Harvard scientists to explore how everyday cooking and haute cuisine can illuminate basic principles in physics and chemistry. Throughout the semester you will watch as chefs reveal the secrets behind some of their most famous culinary creations. Inspired by such cooking mastery, we will then explore the science behind the recipes. Students will gain a solid understanding of the properties and fundamental behaviors of soft matter materials. All food is made of soft materials, and cooking relies on many of their fundamental properties. Topics will include:  emulsions, illustrated by aioli; elasticity, exemplified by the done-ness of a steak; and diffusion, revealed by the phenomenon of spherification, the culinary technique pioneered by Ferran Adria. The course includes laboratory work where students develop their skills as experimental scientists. Other assignments include weekly homeworks, in-class exercises, and a final project where students explore the science of a culinary topic of their choosing.",Occasionally there will be an optional 15-30 minute question and answer session with visiting chefs.,Faculty of Arts & Sciences,4,Not Available for Cross Registration,General Education,Lecture,,FAS Letter Graded,,Science and Technology in Society,,None

The course covers a wide range of perspectives on the climate crisis, from different diagnoses of its origin (capitalism, imperialism, religion, etc.) as well as various approaches for solving it (via technology, policy, social change, etc.). This class exceeded my expectations in the sense that people were engaging really deeply with the readings and I always looked forward to the conversations we would have in section about the material. My TF, Ashton, was super incredible as well – he was really the ideal TF: kind, understanding, honest, and excited to teach.But – and this is a BIG but – Naomi Oreskes is an exceptionally poor professor. She is very likely the worst instructor I have ever had, not just at Harvard, but in my life. Naomi is opinionated and self–centered. She brings a ‘jack of all trades, master of none’ background to her teaching (with an emphasis on ‘master of none’), which is fine, but she is so head–strong in her beliefs that she ends up teaching her students things that are just patently false or internally inconsistent with other things she has said. The lectures present a one–sided interpretation of the causes and solutions for climate change, and sorely lack critical discussion of different perspectives or fact–based analysis.Let me first give a disclaimer. Naomi seems like a good person. She seems friendly and like someone who would be easy to get along with in other aspects of life. But when it comes to discussing the climate crisis and how to solve it, Naomi is one of the most ignorant people I have ever met. And the fact that she force feeds her own beliefs to her students – when these beliefs are based off of incorrect information or internally inconsistent assumptions – is unacceptable.Here’s one example of Naomi simply not understanding the content she tries to teach. We had several lectures about the shortcomings of nuclear power – mainly that nuclear power plants take a long time to build and that nuclear fusion still isn’t commercially viable. That’s all great. But at one point, when criticizing small modular nuclear reactors, Naomi argued that small modular reactors will never be as cost–effective as larger nuclear plants since building smaller reactors means they won’t be able to benefit from economies of scale. This statement reflects a fundamental misconception of economic theory: economies of scale have nothing to do with the size of the product itself. In fact, the entire purpose of building small *modular* nuclear reactors is that they are modular, and therefore can be mass produced in factories and then transported to sites for installation, rather than having to be custom built each time. Small modular reactors are designed exactly so that they can benefit from economies of scale, in contrast to traditional nuclear power plants. It’s remarkable that at a school like Harvard, home to some of the top economists in the world, there are still professors like Naomi who do not understand Econ 101. And this is just one example of Naomi teaching things that are just objectively incorrect.Naomi is also constantly contradicting her own beliefs. Throughout the entire course, she presents internally inconsistent beliefs about the importance of technology and scientific research. On one hand, she stresses that the US federal government has historically played a major role in many technological inventions, and should be seen as an equally valuable source of innovation as the private sector. On the other hand, she is highly skeptical of government investment in clean energy technology R&D today and derided the French government for investing in nuclear power. I left the course confused about what Naomi really thinks about technological solutions for climate change, and honestly am not sure if she has a coherent opinon on technology. Naomi tends to cherry pick success stories and failures to teach to the class, and it ends up painting a patchwork picture of climate solutions that doesn’t yield any coherent conclusion. It feels like she just latches on to certain narratives she hears in the media, and doesn’t really critically evaluate her own beliefs and consider if they are internally consistent or not.There was another lecture where she spent half the time convincing us that going to Mars was not a viable solution for addressing climate change. We know, Naomi, we know. You didn’t have to spend 45 minutes monologuing about the difficulty of timing a launch so that Earth and Mars are closest together or about the governance challenges of establishing an extraterrestrial colony. This is yet another example of Naomi not really having anything meaningful to teach, and just offering a semi–coherent rehashing of her shower thoughts with questionable relevance to the course.Naomi is also quite self–centered. We would barely go a single lecture without her name–dropping one of her celebrity friends, or her bringing up that she was invited to give a talk at XYZ conference, or that some news station interviewed her, or that her book has been made into a film, blah blah blah blah blah. It honestly just felt professionally inappropriate.You might be wondering about Naomi’s qualifications. She has a PhD in geology, and is now a professor of history of science. Why did she make the switch? She told us in lecture that history of science was a less competitive field than geology. I’m not sure what part of her academic background makes her qualified to discuss the engineering or economic challenges of climate change. And I would have thought that any professor who is teaching content outside of their field of expertise would have at least taken the time to create lectures that are factually correct and logically consistent with each other, but that did not seem to be the case with this course.So Naomi, if you’re reading this, I ask you to please reconsider the way you teach this class. You are obviously capable of running a good class, since you are a tenured professor and have been teaching for decades, but I fear this course is over–ambitious in its content and the lectures are often not grounded in facts or logic. I hope that you can be just a little more moderated when you are presenting your own beliefs and that you really fact check everything you’re saying before you teach it to dozens of undergrads. If you really want to inspire the next generation of climate leaders, you need to re–evaluate the way material is presented in lecture. I hope that you can encourage your students to think critically about the complex causes and solutions of climate change, rather than force feed them your personal beliefs that can be premised on factually incorrect statements or internally inconsistent assumptions. You have a year until you teach this course again. I hope you can make use of it.",0.9983,"This course is quite a lot of work; the readings are heavy and sometimes quite dense. But it is incredibly helpful in building a really interdisciplinary understanding of the climate crisis, its causes, and why it's so difficult for us to address it.

We will follow the Armenian experience into the early modern period, when Armenians established a trade network reaching from the Indian subcontinent to Amsterdam, absorbing and informing a kaleidoscope of cultures along the way. We will wrap up with the survival of Armenian traditions in contemporary culture, the role of the Armenian genocide in shaping Armenian identity, including in neighboring Watertown.

If you are interested in the topic, TAKE IT! It is extremely well organized, and expectations for assignments and grading are very clear. Dr. Craycraft is a fantastic professor and person: her office hours were genuinely enlightening and I just wish I took advantage of them more. She knows so much about folklore and a variety of associated fields and when I asked her for resources or wanted to talk about basically any topic, she was super friendly and always had lots of knowledge and insight to share. Auds is the BEST TF ever: take her section if you can!! She is such a cool person and struck an amazing balance between being chill and grounding and understanding while also making me really engage in critical interesting conversations about the material. She made me excited about a 4:30pm section which is hard to do. While not overall graded super harshly, the class definitely does require WORK: more than most GenEds, and unfortunately a lot of it was busyworkish in the form of needing to write 3 150–200 word reading response comments per class which usually took me multiple hours. People definitely ended up cutting corners and not really engaging in the optional readings because we had so much writing to do: I actually don't hate the homework, but it would be good if it was 1–2 comments instead of 3 and that would give more time to engage with the other readings. All of the material on the syllabus is really interesting and organized well: I honestly recommend just checking out the syllabus if you're interested.

The definitions of terms in the discipline are incongruent to how they're used in real life (ie. ""text,"" ""texture,"" and ""context"" all mean something very, very different from the Merriam–Webster definition), and that makes the course hard to understand and hyper liberal artsy–academia–y. Again, if you're into that kinda thing tho, be my guest. That being said, the assignments were very unclear in instruction, very frequent, and grading is harsh in recent gened fashion. I cannot emphasize enough how unclear the instructions were for the class' assignments. Differed in substance from where they were posted (canvas, PDF version, class verbal instruction) and generally confusing.

Now I have found myself much more interested in the big questions of political philosophy and in the influences of classical and medieval thinkers on Western political thought that, for better or worse, dominates much of the modern world. Eric Nelson is an absolutely brilliant lecturer who helps to elucidate key points of each text we read (even if you had trouble understanding/didn't read), and his lecture is like an artistic performance in and of itself. This is evidenced by the not–insignificant number of not–enrolled students who came just to listen. The TF Elias is graduating but is an absolutely wonderful lecturer as well.

We will explore the texture of women’s experiences in the 19th century, the conditions that gave rise to multifaceted societal change, and the ways in which that change unfolded. Finally, our course will consider how these women’s stories are remembered in present-day public culture and whether knowledge of this era can play a role in the urgent societal issues of our own time.","This course meets the ""North America"" History Concentration requirement.

The papers were also varied in the skills they targeted which made them more interesting to write (a primary source analysis, a film review, a research paper). I was grateful for the flexibility provided in what we could write about for each paper and the ability to guide discussions in class to those readings and topics we found most interesting. Dr. Riegel makes a 2 hour seminar feel like it goes by so fast because of all of the great discussions they lead. They are really good at guiding the discussion and answering questions, as well as including multimedia sources to keep the class interested. I am not someone who is very talkative in sections usually but found myself encouraged to share my ideas and that made this class even better. Overall, a great experience and I would take this course or any other taught by Dr. Riegel no matter your concentration.",0.99,"I really recommend this class if you want to learn more about WW2 .

The conflict was fought across much of the globe, ravaging landscapes and ecosystems and wiping villages, towns, and even cities from the face of the earth. Estimates of combined civilian and military deaths typically range between 50,000,000 and 85,000,000, an almost unimaginably devastating toll. Yet how does our understanding of World War II change when we return to literature, art, music, and other cultural works of the time?This course examines civilians’ and soldiers’ everyday experiences of the war through sources such as diaries, photographs, films, songs, and visual art. We will focus on the war in Europe, while considering sources from the war’s other theaters, including the U.S. and the Pacific. Topics will include the war’s origins; life and death under occupation; the impact of strategic bombing; the propaganda war; documentation of wartime atrocities, especially through photography; the Holocaust; the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki; and the pursuit of postwar justice. Throughout the semester, we will employ lenses such as race, gender, and class as we analyze wartime cultural creations, seeking to better understand what it meant to live and die during the most terrible war in human history.",,Faculty of Arts & Sciences,4,Available for Harvard Cross Registration,History & Literature,Seminar,,FAS Letter Graded,,,,Arts and Humanities

We now know that some of the first Homo sapiens appeared over 315,000 years ago. Looking back to even earlier human species, around 2-3 million years ago, we would perhaps be surprised to encounter familiar behaviors: people walking upright, cooperating and socializing, hunting, and using technology. Everything that exists as written history represents less than 2% of what has happened since we emerged as a species, and less than 0.3% of what has happened since archaic humans first emerged. If we want to understand who we are, and why we do the things we do, we need to take a closer look at our relatives in the Paleolithic.     Technology, Behavior, and Human Evolution is an introductory course which offers primatological, fossil, environmental, genetic, and archaeological perspectives on human evolution. Starting with the earliest hominins, each week we will examine central themes and developments in human evolution over the last 6 million years.

When I was deciding whether or not to take this course, I weighed 3 important factors: (1) I had always wanted to read some of the texts on the syllabus after hearing about them through so many history classes in high school, and I didn't know when else I would get the chance to read these texts (2) None of the expos course options particularly excited me and I thought it would be better to spend a year engaging with content that actually excited me rather than a semester with content I was not passionate about (3) I am thinking of being on the pre–med track, for which I would need 2 semesters of English classes, and this course would fulfill that relatively early on in my college experience (as opposed to doing expos now and another elective later on). Given these factors, I felt that I should take this course and I wanted to share this thinking in hopes that it can help other students when making the decision of whether to enroll in Hum10. You will definitely be spending a LOT of time on this course because you have 3 meeting times for this class (which is significantly more than expos I believe) because the reading is very intensive. So that could be another factor to consider when deciding whether to enroll. I won't lie, this class can get out of your hands very quickly –– if you miss one book it is very hard to keep going and catch up simultaneously. While it is possible to rely on SparkNotes to know just enough about the texts for lecture and seminar, this will hurt you in the end for the final (which is a pretty intensive exam), and you may feel unfulfilled not having read all the books which were the reason you decided to take this class. Thus, I recommend making a schedule for how much reading you will get done and when (since Lectures are on Tuesday and Seminar Wednesday, view your week as starting on Wednesday and incrementally work through the books until Monday night / Tuesday). I feel that because there are no actionable assignments tied to reading, it can become easy to forget / overlook until the night before lecture (especially when you have a million other assignments/psets/deliverables/things going on freshman year), thus I think this schedule could be incredibly helpful. The lectures are very cool because you are learning from world–renowned professors, but they can be a bit broad sometimes and I feel don't always do complete justice to the text (which is okay given the fact it is only 75 minutes on some of the most iconic texts in history). However, I feel that the seminars are where the real edification happens. It can be daunting to initially start speaking in seminar, you will probably feel that your thoughts/insights/ideas are not as profound as everyone else's and thus not speak. BUT I promise, everyone else feels the exact same way in the beginning (we all ended up talking about this in the beginning), and the professors/TFs are very open to hearing your thoughts –– they want to hear you speak so they won't judge you negatively for whatever you say (unless it is horribly far off from the text/shows you didn't read). It's always best to give it a shot and raise your hand, share your thoughts and questions and actively engage in both seminar and lab. I have become a much deeper thinker from this, I found that after the first few seminars, I approached the texts differently and began to ask much more acute questions while reading –– helping to not only prepare me for the next seminar discussion (and eventually, the final exam) but also extract more meaning from the texts. I have definitely learned how to ask better questions and become a better thinker. At the end of the day, make sure to speak in seminar because (1) you will feel better about actively engaging from the texts / getting your questions answered (2) other students may be thinking the same / could benefit from your points / questions (3) participation MATTERS. To that end, don't put too much pressure on yourself to speak either. The paper assignments can be scary, especially since they are worth so much of your grade, but I 100% recommend start planning early, go to your TF office hours, and go to the writing center so that you can plan your writing around when those meeting times are to ensure you are making progress and on track to revise/edit/flush out all your points in time for  the deadline. I also recommend signing up for a hum10 mentor and asking them for help! One thing I regret is not going to office hours of other profs/TFs, it is a rare opportunity to learn from these acclaimed professors, and I wish I went to OH more often. I hope this information/advice is helpful in deciding (1) whether or not to take this course and (2) how to approach this course once you decide to take it (you definitely should!)I was very apprehensive initially, but I am very glad I took the course and this is all information I wish I knew ahead of time.",0.9991,"Ok.

When I was deciding whether or not to take this course, I weighed 3 important factors: (1) I had always wanted to read some of the texts on the syllabus after hearing about them through so many history classes in high school, and I didn't know when else I would get the chance to read these texts (2) None of the expos course options particularly excited me and I thought it would be better to spend a year engaging with content that actually excited me rather than a semester with content I was not passionate about (3) I am thinking of being on the pre–med track, for which I would need 2 semesters of English classes, and this course would fulfill that relatively early on in my college experience (as opposed to doing expos now and another elective later on). Given these factors, I felt that I should take this course and I wanted to share this thinking in hopes that it can help other students when making the decision of whether to enroll in Hum10. You will definitely be spending a LOT of time on this course because you have 3 meeting times for this class (which is significantly more than expos I believe) because the reading is very intensive. So that could be another factor to consider when deciding whether to enroll. I won't lie, this class can get out of your hands very quickly –– if you miss one book it is very hard to keep going and catch up simultaneously. While it is possible to rely on SparkNotes to know just enough about the texts for lecture and seminar, this will hurt you in the end for the final (which is a pretty intensive exam), and you may feel unfulfilled not having read all the books which were the reason you decided to take this class. Thus, I recommend making a schedule for how much reading you will get done and when (since Lectures are on Tuesday and Seminar Wednesday, view your week as starting on Wednesday and incrementally work through the books until Monday night / Tuesday). I feel that because there are no actionable assignments tied to reading, it can become easy to forget / overlook until the night before lecture (especially when you have a million other assignments/psets/deliverables/things going on freshman year), thus I think this schedule could be incredibly helpful. The lectures are very cool because you are learning from world–renowned professors, but they can be a bit broad sometimes and I feel don't always do complete justice to the text (which is okay given the fact it is only 75 minutes on some of the most iconic texts in history). However, I feel that the seminars are where the real edification happens. It can be daunting to initially start speaking in seminar, you will probably feel that your thoughts/insights/ideas are not as profound as everyone else's and thus not speak. BUT I promise, everyone else feels the exact same way in the beginning (we all ended up talking about this in the beginning), and the professors/TFs are very open to hearing your thoughts –– they want to hear you speak so they won't judge you negatively for whatever you say (unless it is horribly far off from the text/shows you didn't read). It's always best to give it a shot and raise your hand, share your thoughts and questions and actively engage in both seminar and lab. I have become a much deeper thinker from this, I found that after the first few seminars, I approached the texts differently and began to ask much more acute questions while reading –– helping to not only prepare me for the next seminar discussion (and eventually, the final exam) but also extract more meaning from the texts. I have definitely learned how to ask better questions and become a better thinker. At the end of the day, make sure to speak in seminar because (1) you will feel better about actively engaging from the texts / getting your questions answered (2) other students may be thinking the same / could benefit from your points / questions (3) participation MATTERS. To that end, don't put too much pressure on yourself to speak either. The paper assignments can be scary, especially since they are worth so much of your grade, but I 100% recommend start planning early, go to your TF office hours, and go to the writing center so that you can plan your writing around when those meeting times are to ensure you are making progress and on track to revise/edit/flush out all your points in time for  the deadline. I also recommend signing up for a hum10 mentor and asking them for help! One thing I regret is not going to office hours of other profs/TFs, it is a rare opportunity to learn from these acclaimed professors, and I wish I went to OH more often.

In order to do well, you need to dedicate a substantial amount of time outside of class to go over the worksheet solutions posted at 4:15 PM each day. For me, this is where the actual learning happened. The three problem sets a week are very time consuming on top of the self–teaching required. Before Harvard, I loved math. After this course, I will be taking the minimum math required for my concentration. However, it is definitely possible to get an A in this course if you put in the time with problem sets and self–teaching.

I was placed in Math MA for both the online placement and the skill check but I decided to trust my gut and take this course and it was the best decision. For context, I took AP Calc AB and I got a 3 on the exam.  If you have any prior calc experience, you should be completely fine to take this class instead of Math M. They will try to scare you into switching into MA at the beginning of the course but don't be deterred.Speaking of the beginning of the course, the first three weeks are absolutely the roughest. Three psets a week is exhausting but you will get used to it! Also, they take the most points off of the psets in the beginning so don't let that discourage you either. Focus on learning how your specific CAs grade and what they take points off for. The key to getting full points on the psets is either going to the mqc (ideally on the night that the pset is assigned, not when its due) or having a really solid pset group.Exams aren't terrible, the questions are always easier versions of pset problems. Your biggest enemy will be time. The group portions of the midterms were awful though but you can consult with other groups so you should be able to get full points no matter what.Overall, only take this class if you have to because it is a large time commitment. There are less time consuming ways to fulfill your distributions. But if you have to take it for your concentration, you can do it don't be discouraged!!",0.9482,"Look into other options. Three psets a week is too many if you're not passionate about math. You will seldom know peace. If you have no calculus background, take MA. This course moves way too fast for someone without some calculus background to keep up. Most people in my section had some calculus background and agreed with me on this point.

I was placed in Math MA for both the online placement and the skill check but I decided to trust my gut and take this course and it was the best decision. For context, I took AP Calc AB and I got a 3 on the exam.  If you have any prior calc experience, you should be completely fine to take this class instead of Math M. They will try to scare you into switching into MA at the beginning of the course but don't be deterred.Speaking of the beginning of the course, the first three weeks are absolutely the roughest. Three psets a week is exhausting but you will get used to it! Also, they take the most points off of the psets in the beginning so don't let that discourage you either. Focus on learning how your specific CAs grade and what they take points off for. The key to getting full points on the psets is either going to the mqc (ideally on the night that the pset is assigned, not when its due) or having a really solid pset group.Exams aren't terrible, the questions are always easier versions of pset problems. Your biggest enemy will be time. The group portions of the midterms were awful though but you can consult with other groups so you should be able to get full points no matter what.Overall, only take this class if you have to because it is a large time commitment. There are less time consuming ways to fulfill your distributions. But if you have to take it for your concentration, you can do it don't be discouraged!!",0.9482,"Look into other options. Three psets a week is too many if you're not passionate about math. You will seldom know peace. If you have no calculus background, take MA.

The 3 PSETs a week were bothersome and I often felt like my life was constantly revolving around math, but office hours and MQC were some of the best resources to help me in this course I practically lived at MQC and was there almost every night that they offered it. I came into this class having done AP Calc BC in high school, so none of the concepts in this course were new and I was able to relax with this course. In this class, we had to follow a hands–on style where instead of sitting down in a lecture–style section, we had to spend the whole time at the board trying to solve problems in groups before even being taught the lesson, which I dreaded everyday. However, the staff in this class are so kind and generous with their time. Mario, Sina, and Andrew are some of the best instructors I have come across in college.

They are also not the best if you want a 1 on 1 session and will tell you no, so if you’re struggling with a concept you have to go to office hours or MCQ both of which are packed.

While this class is laid out in a clear and organized manner and there is a lot of support available outside of class (office hours and MQC), it is extremely frustrating. It takes a lot of time and some times is unnecessarily difficult. For context, my feedback is from the perspective of someone who has never taken calculus before, but did well in pre–calculus and MFI. Despite being an introductory calc class, I feel you absolutely need previous knowledge (at least in calc 1) to do well in this class. For the PSets, they are often very long and can take upwards to 5 hours per PSet, if you have never taken calc before. They are do–able if you attend office hours and MQC consistently; however, 3 PSets a week for 4–5 hours each is a lot to ask of students for an introductory calculus class. Also, there were occasional questions on PSets that were not taught, or it was clear we shouldn't be expected to know something (like the CAs in MQC would also be confused on how we would be expected to learn how to approach a problem without the answer key guiding them in the right direction for them to help us). Also, I had a big section of more than 30 students, which differs from the 15 students promoted for each section. I heard from peers in other sections that they had similar class sizes too. Note that a vast majority of the students in the class have taken calculus before; it often feels as if you are very behind if you haven't. With this in mind, the class format where we are pushed to try to figure out worksheets alone at the white board first often looked like student without calc knowledge struggling to keep up, while those students with prior calculus experience just rushes through the problem.

I self–studied Calc BC in high school and placed into 21a but was nervous about starting there as I didn't feel I had a strong enough foundation. If this is you, don't do what I did. You're probably fine just going to 21a if you need it for degree. If you don't, by all means take 1b. But, for me the class felt like a lot of review. If you are taking this class, here is my general experience. Midterms/Finals are a lot easier than the practice tests but follow the same sort of structure. So, if you feel comfortable with the practices, you'll likely do well on the exam. I didn't really utilize MQC or office hours, but I do have friends who found them super helpful. Even if you're solid on the material, it still really helps to get a PSET buddy who will help catch your silly mistakes. Also, make sure you mesh with your TF's teaching style. I had Jonier and he and the CAs for my section were really good. But if you don't feel engaged or like you're learning with your TF, switch to a different time/section.

Roderic is the best, and he makes himself available for office hours, even outside of the ones he has posted. The PSets start out pretty easy (less than 1.5 hours per PSet), but some of the later ones took me a few hours, so make sure to at least budget a good amount of time and work with a good group/go to OH. Our CAs were also great and provided a lot of times for us to work on PSets.My only criticism is that the class gets a little confusing after the first and second midterms, and I wish Roderic spent more time explicitly teaching some of the more difficult techniques in class. Otherwise, if you don't understand the new ideas when you work on problems with your table at the chalkboards, you won't understand anything for the rest of class. This isn't terrible, since I think Roderic is really amazing at explaining things one–one in office hours, but something to watch out for. Overall, though, definitely a super painless math class. I came in as a sophomore, having taken BC Calc in HS and nothing Freshman year. I reviewed basic integration techniques and calc concepts over the summer (just on Khan Academy), which was very helpful but not strictly necessary. If you're worried, like I was, that we'd use more advanced calc class, don't be. You don't need trig–sub, series, etc. I think we might've used integration by parts once or twice? But most of the time when we integrated it was just reverse power rule, very simple. The hard part of this class is understanding the concepts, not actually doing the math (since you don't even need a calculator for the class).",0.9918,,0.0,,0.0,Multivariable Calculus for Social Sciences,MATH   18A,Roderic Guigo Corominas,2025 Fall,Full Term,2025-09-02,2025-12-03,9:00am,10:15am,Mon Wed Fri,12553,No Consent,0,0,False,True,False,True,False,True,False,"Focuses on concepts and techniques of multivariable calculus most useful to those studying the social sciences, particularly economics.

This class changed my perspective on math and life sciences! Professor Wes is the kindest person ever. He genuinely cares so much about this class and the students. He will help if you ask him. (I literally asked him to teach me about the most basic things in course and he always was so enthusiastic about teaching and learning) He genuinely will help you if you just email him. He did say he sympathises with the students a lot because he knows the class and its expectations.The class is difficult. Especially if you are coming straight from AP Calculus BC. That said, I was recommended for MAth ma twice but I chose to take this class. Keep in mind i had excellent grades in Pre Calculus and calc bc and got a five on the test. But, this class is still challenging. There are no MQC or help–rooms, only office hours from CA and Wes, BUT these are more than enough. They are so so helpful. Make sure you form a study group/pset group it will help. Start psets early. I know everyone says this but to be caught up with this class, this is so so necessary. Like, other math classes do not have intensive readings and very fast paced lectures that never seem to stop. SO START EARLY. find your buddies. changed my life when i went into the weekend knowing i tried to do the pset fully even though i skipped some questions. PSETS are meant to be challenging, dont get discouraged. YOu will get a hang of it. Midterms are tough, learn to manage your time. I would not say they are not representative of the class lectures or the psets. Start studying for it early! Do your cheat sheet! Put whatever Wes gives you on the cheatsheet because it will help.The final project is what makes this class very different. But the professor is there with you every step of the way! He literally will work through thanksgiving break for you. Very very helpful and never denies to help.Take this class IF: you are very curious, dont think grades are everything that matter over learning. If you're a pre–med, although you do not have to be. If you want to look at life sciences from a different perspective that will change everything. If you want research experience with a really amazing professor and class environment.Don't take this class if you are not the above things.Be cautious.

I've never been that comfortable with math. However, I think reading the course evals mentally prepared me for what was to come, and I tried to overprepare in the beginning to control my success as much as possible. For example, I did the Review2Preview module before the class started and wrote down all my questions about things (even simple stuff like how limits/Reimann sums worked). That module helped prepare me a LOT. I'd read the textbook chapters and watch the Panopto videos before class (try to ALWAYS watch the videos!! they are so useful!). I also went to MQCs and office hours when I could, checking my work with other students. Office hours + MQCs gave me the confidence I needed to know I could do well in the class, as everyone was so encouraging.The first unit was the hardest for me, for sure. After midterm 1, I developed a better gauge for what to expect out of the class. They emphasized that ""struggling is learning"" and active learning is your path to success in this class. Make group chats with other students, work on homework with them, use your resources. My best studying tools for midterms were: (1) review notes, (2) write down ANY questions you have and ask your TF after class or in MQC/office hours/workshops, (3) make Quizlets to memorize rules/theorems/equations, (4) do ALL of the practice exams and write down questions/flag problems you aren't sure of the solution for and bring those to TF/MQC/office hours. The practice exams are absolutely the key to doing well on the exam.Finally, spread the Psets out over two days or ""sessions."" Doing it all at once can be overwhelming.

Taking it was one of the best decisions I made in my time at Harvard. It made me wonder whether I should have been a math concentrator. Eva is absolutely amazing. She is such an incredible teacher and knows how to teach the content, keep everyone engaged, and make it fun. The pace of the class is perfect. Doing three problem sets a week is a lot of work but honestly, I looked forward to getting started on the problem sets. The math department at Harvard is absolutely incredible and does an insanely good job at math pedagogy. I definitely recommend taking 21a. It had been about 4 years since I last did math and still I found myself really enjoying 21a. The summer/winter before you take it, I would recommend quickly going over integration techniques, which I did not do but which probably would have benefited me a bit. The class is super visual and when you take it, you can literally feel yourself getting smarter and feel your brain thinking about things in ways that it is not used to thinking about things. At some point in the semester, I started having math dreams about problems from the class and it was super fun. Amazing class. If you can take it with Eva, that'll make it a hundred thousand times better. If you're a freshman or sophomore who used to like math back in high school but now are concentrating in a non–STEM subject and wondering whether you should take math or not, let this be your sign to take the plunge and take math.

Any sense of hubris you have, get rid of it. This course may not be Math 25 or 55, but for someone who has never done Linear algebra, proofwriting, or set theory, you may very well still find yourself feeling a bit challenged. I took A LONG time to adapt to this course. Professor Wood is a great guy, and you can tell he is enthusiastic about what he does, but I must admit I felt so lost up until a few lectures after the second Midterm. To be entirely honest, I am not completely sure if its because I am just a slow student, or maybe lectures weren't as clear as they could be, but let me tell you, I really suffered my first semester because of this class. I didn't really know how to do the PSETS, the first two midterms didn't go so great for me, and there were days when I severely doubted myself. I was also taking some other Pset courses, so the workload was definitely weighing on me, so if you are a first–year student also doing a lot of STEM–related courses, please make sure you know how to manage your time properly regardless of which math course you pick.Just know this course might either be a complete breeze for you, or a warzone. It really depends on who you are. I certainly think Wood's lectures were much better towards the latter half of the semester, and I found myself thoroughly enjoying them (a very stark contrast to what I felt towards the start of the semester). I also think that all things considered, because it was his first time teaching this course, it wasn't that bad. I certainly believe he will do a better job next fall, and well, I have enough faith in this that I'm sticking with 22b and not dropping to 21a. If you do end up taking this course and struggle, please please please go to office hours. They saved me, and they will save you too. The CAs and TFs for this course were amazing (shout out to Zak, Josh, and Mitchell), and Dr. Wood is also particularly helpful and insightful during his office hours.All in all, like I said before, really think about what math course you take. Do I regret taking 22a? Honestly, at first, I thought it would be a resounding yes, but honestly, the course grew on me. Yeah I struggled a ton, and you might too, but it's in those moments where you truly learn who you are as a person and a student. The truth is, I may not leave this course with the greatest grade in the world, but I learned things from Wood's lectures, I learned things from the other students I worked with, and I learned a lot from my study sessions. So I guess take 22a if you're like me, unsure about where to start with math at Harvard, not wanting to do something as extreme as 25 or 55, but wanting a little more to prepare you at the start of your college journey.",0.9982,"To preface, this is coming not from a student that didn't do well in the class, but from someone who eventually got an A in the course. At first, I decided to pay close attention to the lectures and the lecturer, but after the first and second midterms, I quickly realized that the reason I was not doing well is because the lectures do not properly cover the material at all. Professor Wood just does problems on the board without teaching students how to properly think through the problems, which does not work at all. In fact, reading through the textbook also revealed that some of the concepts we learned in lecture were taught in completely the wrong way. After this, I decided to not pay attention to the lecturer and learn on my own, and this resulted in me doing well on the third midterm and the final. My success in the course was due to the fact that I realized how terrible the professor is at teaching and learned how to teach the concepts to myself.

The analogy of drinking water from a firehose is not at all inaccurate and I would not recommend taking it alongside more than one other really difficult course (like physics 16,CS61 from what I've heard for example) – it is possible, but it will likely crush you. One other really difficult course is doable if you're very comfortable with, I have friends that have done it, but they were in a position where those courses were very commensurate with their skill level. Nonetheless, despite the extreme difficulty, I would still recommend this course as strongly as I am capable if you love math. You do NOT have to be a genius with boatloads of competition mathematics experience in order to take this class. The highest level of mathematics I ever did formally in high school was single variable calculus and the basics of complex numbers and some very very elementary proofs, and I was still able to score above average in the course without sacrificing my entire life on its altar. I would however say that it is quite difficult to do well in the class without at least one of the following:– Some experience in high school with more advanced mathematics, especially linear algebra. This is not so much because it will directly come up as something tested in the course, as although we do spend a lot of time on linear algebra it takes a form almost unrecognizable to many of my friends who did linear algebra in high school, but rather because it gives useful intuition as to how to think concretely about very abstract concepts, and a concrete example to reach for when you want to play around with a new idea. – Exposure to and interest in abstract mathematics. This was what I had that I felt helped me the most. This doesn't need to be formal – most of my background came from a nigh–unhealthy amount of mathematics youtube videos watched as well as having worked through the beginnings of several lecture notes covering the beginnings of a couple of the university–level subjects I was interested in. These do not need to be directly related to the course material at all, but rather help get you in the mindset of abstract mathematics – figuring out how to set up a proof, how to see the kinds of patterns and tricks that come up in abstract math, and also just to enjoy the little references to other fields of mathematics that often come up. The course basically assumes being comfortable with this mode of thinking and although you can pick it up along the way, trial by fire and all that, it does help to have it already.With that out of the way, a final couple notes on the difficulty of the course: firstly, although it is indeed incredibly difficult, that difficulty is fairly frontloaded in that it doesn't get too much worse than the first couple problem sets (not that it gets much easier either, but it does mean that if you survive the first couple weeks without completely burning yourself up you can likely survive the rest) and secondly, again despite that difficulty the grading is relatively lenient, and as long as you solve the problems you will likely score quite well. This is especially true of the fact that extensive collaboration is tolerated and actively encouraged by the course – it becomes much much more manageable once you find a good problem set group to work through it with and the scope of what kind of collaboration is permitted is quite broad. A tip on study groups – try and find a group with a roughly comparable skill level to yours in the class, as being in a problem set group with someone much more or less mathematically able than you is generally not very productive for either party. This also helps with another issue that I found to be quite common: impostor syndrome. Since many people taking this course would have been the resident math whiz at their high school but are just another student in this class it can often be easy to feel as if you don't really deserve to be in the class, and having a group of people around you who are going through the same sort of thing and have a similar skill level to you can really help with that. That said, it also helps to have a group of people whose skills complement each other – the joke in my pset group was always that we had the logician (me), the physicist, and the generalist mathematician, and our respective orientations helped a lot with building solutions together; I could often spot slight technicalities that the other two missed, the physicist had very strong concrete intuitions for things and could see angles we couldn't, and the generalist mathematician often had a lot of insights that I was too deep in the weeds to see and that weren't the physicist's style. Now as to the professor. I do not exaggerate when I say Denis Auroux is the BEST professor I have ever had in any academic context. He is a brilliant, lucid lecturer who takes incredibly deep, intricate concepts that I personally would have had to spend many times the number of hours we had to understand otherwise and makes them crystal clear and motivated. He always makes sure to really work through the details of why a result is true while keeping it approachable and comprehensible, which is a terribly difficult balance to strike. He was also eminently available to all of his students – he generally responds to slack questions within minutes (he's so quick that it's become something of a joke amongst classmates) and his office hours are pure gold. He makes a conscious effort in them to make sure every single question is heard and answered throughly and he gives incredibly well thought out hints. One can also very clearly tell how much he cares about his students – he takes the time to get to know each of their idiosyncrasies and work with them. He's also just very approachable and willing to laugh with you. The CAs are also as a whole excellent, giving incredibly useful advice on the problems and having office hours on all but one day of the week.As for the content, it is incredibly deep and interesting (although in order to cover so much it is done at incredibly breakneck pace). The main areas covered are group theory (up to and including the Sylow approach to classification of finite groups), abstract linear algebra (with a stringent focus on doing things rigorously and thoroughly, which makes it look very different to the kind of linear algebra many will have done in high school since we don't do much at all with matrix computations, for example even defining the determinant is the last thing we do in the linear algebra section of the course), and their intersection in the form of representation theory. This is covered in the lectures, but a lot of the growth in the course happens in the problem sets. These are generally 8–12 questions in length and will unless you are really brilliant take you most of the week to solve – finishing a math 55 pset is always a bright moment in the week. The problems are very rarely computational and often force you to be very creative in coming up with a solution. The advantage fo this very heavy problem set workload though is tat generally speaking because they force you to become so intimately familiar with the material in order to solve them you generally have to do very little studying outside of just doing the problem sets.Finally, I just want to issue a final recommendation to please, if you do love math, TAKE THIS COURSE. It will be hard, it will eat up a lot of your time, but you will come out a better mathematician than I daresay any other class at any other university could have made you. I can deal with mathematical problems and concepts now that I could never have even begun to wrap my head around before taking this course, and I am much more confident in my ability to actually contribute to complex math. Furthermore, the content itself is just too beautiful to pass up – you will prove results just in the problem sets that are themselves substantial and will make you wonder at the beauty of math. There are very few other experiences that have made me marvel at the sheer beauty of the thing quite as much as math 55. It has been hands down my favourite course of my first semester and quite possibly my favourite academic experience full stop. If you love math and are willing to really put a lot of time into it and want to beecome a better mathematician, this course will be life–changing.

Real Analysis. First and foremost, there is no getting around this. This class is hard. Here's the good, the bad, and the ugly: The good: This is a difficult class, which sometimes can be made more difficult due to: idiosyncracies, arbitrary grading, and unnecessary difficulty on assignments. YMMV,  but there wasn't a lot of that under Prof. Max Weinreich. That's not to say the class was perfect. But it also was not horrible.  Max was a great lecturer, but a little monotone sometimes. He was hard to reach outside of class/OH. The midterm was fair and we got a nice curve. The bad: However, some things you should know: Your experience in the class will depend a lot on who the professor is, and how many times you go to office hours a week. Some Psets were easy and doable, others were near impossible unless you went to OH. There were two WONDERFUL CA's, but other CAs were not as good. The first few Psets will be graded as if you were a mathematician, and errors will cost you. Then, they relax the grading. This tends to be due to different reasons, but I like to think is to give you a false sense of improvement. There's arbitrary grading and you should reach out when this happens. The ugly: Some problems were hard enough that CAs even had trouble solving them. If a CA doesn't know how to solve a problem... that will tell you. This is my general guideline: If the Prof is writing their problems, you'll be ok. If they are choosing problems from Rudin, then good luck. This was a WAY better class than last Fall, which under all metrics was a horrible experience for everyone. The final exam was rough. Instead of testing knowledge of a definition or theorem, you need to realize ""the trick"" that each problem requires. This is more on intuition than true knowledge. We were given a review sheet of 10 problems and told to study it intensely. Only 3 problems showed up in the final and one of them was *heavily* modified. It should have been a take–home or something. TLDR: Max is good, other profs may not be. OH is the most valuable resource for Psets.

These two things combined made me feel that, even though I would often leave with some kernels of useful intuition, attending lecture was on the whole a waste of time, and so I stopped attending after the first 2 or 3 weeks.Another issue I had was that the homeworks, while mostly fine, sometimes contained extremely tedious, useless problems for seemingly no reason (e.g. verify that these theorems hold for this group by checking all 20+ cases), which really gave me the impression that Joe had both not written the homeworks and also had no idea what was on them. By the start of finals, we had gotten back 2 of the 11 homeworks, so there was also no real way to gauge one's performance or level of learning in the class; I also suspect, writing this the day before grades come out, that our final exams were never graded or looked at.

With that being said, it's not a rigorous introduction to differential geometry. If you want something more rigorous I'd recommend the grad version or the one at MIT. I was expecting it to be a more proof–based so I'm a bit sad about that. We also worked almost exclusively in Euclidean space, which isn't great for me as I'm a physics concentrator who wanted to take this class in preparation for taking General Relativity. Oliver is also super passionate about graph theory and spent a lot of time on that which personally felt irrelevant to me and the course, but the problems on the psets were kinda cool. It's a bit sad because I feel like we didn't get the standard course where we learn from day 1 the definition of tensors, manifolds, etc. Instead we did a lot of calculation and plugging in formulas. It's cool and the course felt a bit on the lighter side but I was wishing I'd get a more rigorous introduction to such a cool topic. I say this with a bit of reservation because Oliver is such a sweet and passionate teacher. He really means well and I think he might've tried too hard to make the class accessible to students of all math backgrounds.

As my second exposure to complex analysis, I have come away with it with a much better intuition and understanding of the intuition and ideas of the field, which is testament to Professor Siu’s excellent lecturing and lecture notes – they are geared towards panoramic understanding of the field and how it connects to other fields of mathematics, emphasising that the beauty of analysis lies in the use and creation of its tools (kernels, series/ product expansions, the symmetries of certain special functions considered, and the ideas of growth order and factorisation) and drawing parallels between real and complex analysis whenever relevant to fortify understanding of both. The narrative of the course stuck very closely to the historical development of the field, which made the topics feel very naturally motivated and the flow of ideas much more coherent than I have seen in most other analysis courses. Problem sets were written well and made the material familiar, though a couple of them (with the glaring example being the final exam which took me upwards of 50 hours to finish) were too long in my opinion and could be shortened to around 75% of their current length and still serve their purpose, though the three signature problems of the course on the Bergman kernel, Koebe’s construction of Riemann mappings, and the ‘triangle tessalation’ problem were all very interesting and memorable. With this change implemented though, this definitely has the potential to be one of the best courses I have ever taken.",0.9818,"Very good class on complex analysis. This class is famously extremely hard (back in the day when Siu used to teach it a few years ago), but I got the sense that he really listened to past QGuide feedback and toned down the course by quite a lot. This meant that we covered a lot less than what he intended to teach (so no Gelfond–Schneider, no univalent function theory, etc.) but we got to cover the topics we did in much greater depth (including many cool topics such as Nevanlinna theory, elliptic function theory). One gripe I have is that Siu would often repeat lectures (as in he'd start the next lecture saying the exact same thing he said the previous lecture), but I totally get it and it helps me revise a lot as well.The workload is very lightweight. Siu wants the homeworks to be trivial extensions of the lecture material where we get the chance to get our hands dirty working with the material, and it indeed was exactly what he intended. Each homework took me less than a day and helped me understand class material a lot more (homework problems were strictly either Stein Shakarchi Complex Analysis problems or his own problems extending ideas / proofs from his lecture materials). The final was a slightly longer homework, and this was also very doable.

I think that Ls1a had an excellent curriculum, and masterfully blended chemistry and biology topics, which made each topic more digestible and understandable. I strongly encourage taking Ls1a for anyone who is looking to get a really strong foundation in these fields. I believe that taking AP Bio and AP Chem prior to taking Ls1a strongly helps make the class more understandable, but you need no real background, so it is possible to take without having taken those courses or an IB equivalent previously. However, LPSA may be more digestible if you didn't take AP Bio and AP Chem in high school. What I like best about this class is that it provides something for everyone, in terms of learning styles. The content is essentially taught three times: learning pods, lectures, and section. The best part is that learning pods provide both videos and textbook readings, which my friends and I are pretty evenly split between. Doing both is great, but usually just one will suffice. Personally, I only use chapters because I struggle to focus in lecture, and I learn pretty well from just reading and taking notes on these chapters. Section is really great for its small environment (~12 students each), which is additionally great for people who can't focus on lecture, and either way, it goes into much greater depth than lecture does which is super helpful for clarifying topics.Generally, I really think this is a great class to take. It is honestly not that difficult if you just put the time and effort in. The midterms and final are extremely fair, and the labs and problem sets aren't too time–consuming or overwhelmingly difficult, but rather help to solidify concepts. I do suggest finding a study group to check your work with, however, as it is easy to make small mistakes on homeworks, and checking has always helped me solidify the concepts in my own brain. Overall, as long as you put the time in, the class is very digestible.TLDR; take this class if you have already taken AP Chem and AP Bio, or if you just want a fuller foundation in these topics. There is something to fit everyone's learning style, and if you simply put in the time to learn in the way that works best for you, the class is very reasonable and super informative thanks to its excellently crafted and integrated curriculum.

Like many have said in past q–reports, LS50 feels like 60% math, 40% everything else. As a non–math person, LS50 allowed me to gain an intuition on the why behind some parts of bio (like thermodynamics, chemotaxis, and cell cycle) but it led to psets and midterms being undoubtedly challenging, despite maximizing practice resources and attending CA office hours (make sure to attend office hours, if you take LS50!!).The content in this course is somewhat scattered but it was all quite fascinating as a look back on the semester; I'll go through each of the main ideas. 1) Probability/stats – taught by Michael well and was pretty interesting. 2) Chemistry – Emma is an amazing lecturer and will hold your attention for the entire hour and 15 minutes! 3) Lac operon – very fascinating and Andrew is a hilarious lecturer. 4) Dynamical systems – Ben is a great lecturer, but many peers and I agree this material could be removed from LS50. 4) Molecular/classical genetics – foundational topic in molecular bio and taught by Emma/Ben. 5) Yeast cell cycle – interesting but most relevant for the lab project with Piyush (taught by Andrew). 6) Thermodynamics/stat mech – while, in theory, it's interesting material and both Doeke and Michael teach well, this will suck the soul out of you at times and question your will to take LS50. 7) Eukaryotic gene expression/dev bio – Kara is such an incredible lecturer and will make you excited to attend lecture! 8) Diffusion/chemotaxis – kind of thrown in at the end and confusing, but still fundamentally interesting.It's important to mention that all of the instructors and CAs are warm, approachable individuals that really try hard to support you along the way, despite the material being challenging.

Go to as many office hours as you can and need to help clarify concepts from the professors. Go to section (I know it's not mandatory but go anyway) because it's very helpful to review what we learned in class. And go to as many of the CA office hours in the evenings that you can (balance this with your other classes). Ask your classmates for help too – sometimes they can explain a few things to you and you can explain a few things to them, and we can all learn from each other!

There is no question. I don't know a single student in my class that did not suffer. However, you will learn so so much that you will be incredibly grateful at the end, even though it's a very hard class. You will also trauma bond with the other people in your class through the psets and exams. By the way, you will absolutely get failing grades on your exams, and that is absolutely okay, please do not worry, you will be fine in the class. It's about the effort, participation, and improvement you make.3) This class is not for people who do not truly care about life science and are very interested in learning and spending time with the concepts. It's also not for people who don't want to do math, physics, or coding, and are really only interested in the bio and chem parts. 4) Start your psets as early as possible and try to get as much of them done before Thursday night.

As soon as you start the class, go sign up for hours from ARC tutoring (if Jimena or Rae are still tutors for the class, sign up for their hours, they're the best!). Even if you don't need the help for the first couple of psets, you will absolutely start needing the help once the mathy concepts start kicking in. Go to as many office hours as you can and need to help clarify concepts from the professors. Go to section (I know it's not mandatory but go anyway) because it's very helpful to review what we learned in class. And go to as many of the CA office hours in the evenings that you can (balance this with your other classes). Ask your classmates for help too – sometimes they can explain a few things to you and you can explain a few things to them, and we can all learn from each other!

There is no question. I don't know a single student in my class that did not suffer. However, you will learn so so much that you will be incredibly grateful at the end, even though it's a very hard class.

By the way, you will absolutely get failing grades on your exams, and that is absolutely okay, please do not worry, you will be fine in the class. It's about the effort, participation, and improvement you make.3) This class is not for people who do not truly care about life science and are very interested in learning and spending time with the concepts. It's also not for people who don't want to do math, physics, or coding, and are really only interested in the bio and chem parts. 4) Start your psets as early as possible and try to get as much of them done before Thursday night. I know we all liked to procrastinate in high school, but if you at all value your sleep in any way, don't leave things until Thursday night.5) The professors, TFs, and CAs truly truly care about you as people.

Every day in class and outside of class is a day of learning. I am usually not a fan of flip classroom styled classes, but this course has changed my mind. We have recorded materials that we need to watch before lectures, and they form the foundation for our discussion in our class. I think the pace of the class is food because every week, we move onto a different topic. Sometimes, they may be related but not always. I think having time during the weekend to watch the recorded videos is a perfect opportunity for me to pace myself of the foundation I need. If I learned the foundation in lecture, I would be so lost because of the amount of material covered in an hour. I am a bit slow, so it takes me about 2–3 hours to get through the weekly videos. The discussions in class are really helpful because we dissect experimental results, which helps us when we complete the psets and just think like a scientist. This class would NOT work if we learned the material in class and conducted a discussion in class. There would simply not be enough time. We learn so much during discussions, and it is really important that the slides are more clearly noted with what we have learned. At the beginning of the class, the course staff was like ‘oh, we cover a lot, sometime if you take notes than it will distract you and make you miss important details’ and I was like ok, that means post discussion slides would be detailed with notes, and that only proves to be true for some and not all of the discussion materials. Course staff:We have three different lecturers, Dominic, Vlad, and Emma. Each three of the lecturers vary differently in their discussion style. It's like getting whiplash every 3–4 weeks. Out of the three, my favorite are Dominic and Emma. Dominic is good at fostering discussion ground. Emma is the most clear to the point. Vlad is very verbose, beats around the bush half the time, slides are not clearly labeled. I had a great and knowledgable TF that made section less painless. All of the CAs have taken the class before, and they have a superb understanding of the course material and the stress that goes along with this class.Section:The section is 4 hours long because it includes going over lecture material and lab. I really enjoyed the lab components. It is indeed about 3–4 hours a week, but I had a great randomly assigned lab group and a wonderful TF. Psets:The psets are not that much of a time commitment. If you go to the right CA office hours, you can get all of it done within the single hour and then have some spare time on your own to polish the answers you submit. They highly revolve around experimental data, which I think is great for fostering critical thinking.Exams:I wish the exams covered also conceptual questions and basic knowledge rather than just dissecting experimental results. Dissecting the amount of experimental results that we do in an hour and 15 minutes of exam time is sometimes unreasonable and not practical. In the real world, you would have lot more time to come up with the conclusions that we were to ask to come up with in the exam room. Background:I am not an MCB concentrator. I have never taken ls1a and ls1b before. I did relatively fine in the class. I would say in the pond full of premeds that this class is, the class was a bit more stressful due to the students than the professors. Students seem to always be a bit competitive, and it might just be me, but a bit judgmental. I get some off–putting looks when I say something weird or incorrect in OH or in section, but I feel like that is what OH and section is for. Section TF and OH CAs are generally very good at slowing down the pace to help with understanding. It’s just that people who have a good on hold on the content are much louder than the people who are confused. People in the class are generally pretty cracked, but as an individual, I still need to iron out the confusion I have. There are numerous times where I were made to feel inferior, but I think that is the nature of a biology class, and you can’t take a biology class like this without having this many premeds in it. But don’t let this be your deciding factor of whether you take this class or not. I really enjoyed the class regardless of how I felt about the students.",0.9988,"Be very careful. Do not take this course unless you absolutely have to. I feel very snubbed by this courses way of handling its grades. RUN! If you are not concentrating in MCB or CPB, please don't do this course it could destroy your GPA that you've spent your freshmen or sophomore year building.

Every day in class and outside of class is a day of learning. I am usually not a fan of flip classroom styled classes, but this course has changed my mind. We have recorded materials that we need to watch before lectures, and they form the foundation for our discussion in our class. I think the pace of the class is food because every week, we move onto a different topic. Sometimes, they may be related but not always. I think having time during the weekend to watch the recorded videos is a perfect opportunity for me to pace myself of the foundation I need. If I learned the foundation in lecture, I would be so lost because of the amount of material covered in an hour. I am a bit slow, so it takes me about 2–3 hours to get through the weekly videos. The discussions in class are really helpful because we dissect experimental results, which helps us when we complete the psets and just think like a scientist. This class would NOT work if we learned the material in class and conducted a discussion in class. There would simply not be enough time. We learn so much during discussions, and it is really important that the slides are more clearly noted with what we have learned. At the beginning of the class, the course staff was like ‘oh, we cover a lot, sometime if you take notes than it will distract you and make you miss important details’ and I was like ok, that means post discussion slides would be detailed with notes, and that only proves to be true for some and not all of the discussion materials. Course staff:We have three different lecturers, Dominic, Vlad, and Emma. Each three of the lecturers vary differently in their discussion style. It's like getting whiplash every 3–4 weeks. Out of the three, my favorite are Dominic and Emma. Dominic is good at fostering discussion ground. Emma is the most clear to the point. Vlad is very verbose, beats around the bush half the time, slides are not clearly labeled. I had a great and knowledgable TF that made section less painless. All of the CAs have taken the class before, and they have a superb understanding of the course material and the stress that goes along with this class.Section:The section is 4 hours long because it includes going over lecture material and lab. I really enjoyed the lab components. It is indeed about 3–4 hours a week, but I had a great randomly assigned lab group and a wonderful TF. Psets:The psets are not that much of a time commitment. If you go to the right CA office hours, you can get all of it done within the single hour and then have some spare time on your own to polish the answers you submit.

Dissecting the amount of experimental results that we do in an hour and 15 minutes of exam time is sometimes unreasonable and not practical. In the real world, you would have lot more time to come up with the conclusions that we were to ask to come up with in the exam room. Background:I am not an MCB concentrator. I have never taken ls1a and ls1b before. I did relatively fine in the class. I would say in the pond full of premeds that this class is, the class was a bit more stressful due to the students than the professors.

I get some off–putting looks when I say something weird or incorrect in OH or in section, but I feel like that is what OH and section is for. Section TF and OH CAs are generally very good at slowing down the pace to help with understanding. It’s just that people who have a good on hold on the content are much louder than the people who are confused. People in the class are generally pretty cracked, but as an individual, I still need to iron out the confusion I have.

Why do our cells need to be compartmentalized? How do individual proteins traffic into their final destinations to perform distinct functions in our cells? In this class, we will explore the organelles present in our cells and the specialized functions they perform to maintain cellular metabolism. Additionally, we will examine how dysregulation in organelle functions contributes to diseases and what therapeutic strategies are currently available.This course consists of weekly, in-depth lecture sessions and primary literature discussion sessions. Each week, you'll engage in complementary sessions — 'lecture' and 'discussion' — that help enhance your understanding of how the current knowledge of organelle biology has been shaped by research and what open questions remain in the field.In lecture sessions, you will learn about the historical discoveries of individual subcellular organelles and classical and modern methodologies used to study organelle functions. Topics covered include fundamental cellular compartments mainly involved in cellular metabolism, such as the nucleus, mitochondria, lysosomes, lipid droplets, stress granules, and peroxisomes, as well as their communication. During primary literature discussion sessions, you will learn to identify key questions in cell biology and design critical experiments to address those questions.

Why do our cells need to be compartmentalized? How do individual proteins traffic into their final destinations to perform distinct functions in our cells? In this class, we will explore the organelles present in our cells and the specialized functions they perform to maintain cellular metabolism. Additionally, we will examine how dysregulation in organelle functions contributes to diseases and what therapeutic strategies are currently available.This course consists of weekly, in-depth lecture sessions and primary literature discussion sessions. Each week, you'll engage in complementary sessions — 'lecture' and 'discussion' — that help enhance your understanding of how the current knowledge of organelle biology has been shaped by research and what open questions remain in the field.In lecture sessions, you will learn about the historical discoveries of individual subcellular organelles and classical and modern methodologies used to study organelle functions. Topics covered include fundamental cellular compartments mainly involved in cellular metabolism, such as the nucleus, mitochondria, lysosomes, lipid droplets, stress granules, and peroxisomes, as well as their communication. During primary literature discussion sessions, you will learn to identify key questions in cell biology and design critical experiments to address those questions.

Good class, recommend it!",0.9937,"For any future students, let me tell you, MCB 294 is just plain disappointing. It is probably the most underwhelming class I’ve had in my whole time at Harvard as a student. On paper, it sounded cool – each week you get a different professor to introduce their research, but in reality, it was a hot mess from start to finish.First off, the professor barely even showed up. Professor Nancy Kleckner? She was MIA for like 90% of the class. She only popped in for the first day, one random lecture, and then one “check–in” session. After that, it was all on the Teaching Fellow (TF)—who honestly wasn’t much help either. She barely tried to connect with us, mostly just sat in the corner on her laptop like she had better things to do. Nobody tried to build any type of community, and it left everyone feeling lost and disconnected. Oh, and the room setup was confusing too. Half of my classmates were stuck sitting on the side against the wall, while the rest of us got to be in the action at a central table. However, this led to my peers that sat on the outside feeling left out of discussions, and a strong sense of disconnect.When it came to assignments, you only had two things all semester: a three–page paper and a 10–minute presentation. However, don’t expect much help on that. The only support we got was a one–on–one Zoom with Nancy to “brainstorm” ideas for the paper and a group feedback session—but that was not enough. There was no rubric, no clear guidance, nothing. Then, Nancy's feedback? It was mostly negative and confusing, leaving everyone frustrated and feeling like they had no direction. While her comments were valid at times, it just came off extremely condescending, and did not motivate us to do better.Then things just kept getting worse. During one of the feedback sessions, the TF accidentally screen shared an email from Nancy about a student’s final project in front of the whole class, which was straight up embarrassing. But that wasn’t even the worst part. When it came time for the final presentations, Nancy didn’t even bother to show up. For the big event that was supposed to wrap up everything, she straight up ghosted our class due to having a conference abroad. To be honest, most of us wished that Nancy could've either rescheduled for a day that she could attend, or at least chosen to be there remotely, instead of completely leaving us behind. Then, to make matters worse, one of the backup professors who was supposed to give feedback came late. According to my friends in that later section, the professor didn’t even show up for the first hour of the presentations, meaning a bunch of them got no feedback at all. Long story short, this class was a straight–up mess. No structure, no support, and no real engagement from the staff. Yeah, there’s not much work to do each week, but that’s only because the class had no true direction. This experience honestly left me questioning my whole grad school experience, and I’d say avoid this class at all costs.

Students will work with a variety of notational systems, including Western staff notation, the Nashville number system, lead sheet notation, and others. In addition, the class features a series of workshops on digital audio workstation GarageBand to develop skills for manipulating and analyzing recorded material. Who should take this class? Students with a strong interest in the “nuts and bolts” of music who are looking to learn about the stylistic conventions of popular music and European tonal music, and to understand how musical pieces in these genres are put together.  What will I take away from this class? This course will help students develop a solid foundation for critical listening, aural and notation-based analysis, and musical interpretation. Students will gain basic fluency in recording and manipulating audio files. These skills can be applicable to a variety of musical contexts: performance, composition, songwriting, music criticism, and listening.","Department of Music courses in music theory will no longer require students to complete a placement exam.

On one hand, how are music and sound employed to support an external (and often fictional) narrative? On the other, how does music studies tell stories about music to a variety of audiences? Accordingly, this course is divided loosely in half. The first half of the course focuses on storytelling with music; we will survey and analyze a variety of narrative mediums that incorporate music and sound—including opera, film, and games—in order to gain a sense of the roles of the aural dimension in fiction. We will also interrogate the differences between plot and narrative, asking whether or not music has the power to narrate.

I went into this course with prior knowledge of the script and elementary Persian vocab/terms, so this class took roughly 2 hours out of my typical work–week. I assume it would be a steep learning curve and relatively fast–paced at the beginning of the semester (approx. 6–10 hours a week) for complete beginners to Persian, but Prof. Ebrahimian did an excellent job engaging with students through pop culture references, interesting personal anecdotes to augment our lessons, and constantly reviewing and reinforcing key concepts in class with patience and encouragement.  This course, according to Prof. Ebrahimian, goes at roughly twice the pace of a typical American college curriculum for introductory Persian, but don't be discouraged; it is structured incredibly well and graded very fairly.  You will be surrounded by students from all backgrounds and stages of education––from scholars at the Divinity School to undecided freshmen and physics PhD candidates––and you will emerge at the end of the semester with an eagerness and preparedness to continue studying Persian, as well as a far deeper appreciation for Persianate studies. Prof. Ebrahimian is such an experienced and talented instructor, and it's a shame that Harvard treats its preceptors so disrespectfully––he was very well–liked and respected among all students in the class, but Harvard administrators abruptly terminated his contract for flimsy reasons (yes, Harvard's preceptor contracts basically allow at–will termination after their third year) and he had no other choice than to find a different job which resulted in him leaving in the middle of the semester. A substitute preceptor, Masoud Ariankhoo, took over from November until the end of the semester, and like Prof. Ebrahimian, he was an incredible language instructor with deeply insightful methods for language acquisition and an unmatched patience for our class, especially given the unfortunate and chaotic circumstances surrounding his rushed employment and the responsibilities he had to shoulder. To future readers of this QGuide, I can guarantee that your preceptor will be an amazing instructor who, like Profs. Ebrahimian and Ariankhoo, will stir your love for this beautiful language and more than adequately prepare you for future studies in Persian. I only hope that Harvard will treat them with the dignity and respect they deserve. I enrolled in this class in my very last semester as a college student because I had promised myself I would take full advantage of the exploratory opportunities offered by a liberal arts education, and I had wanted to study Persian since high school but never found the time to actually take it until the very last moment.

Dr Beach is one of the most effective teachers I've ever had, and one of the kindest as well. She pushes you to do well in this course in all the right ways, and I often left the class feeling like I genuinely learned something new about the field. Content–wise, it's a fantastic primer into the world of auditory cognitive neuroscience, and each week is a student presentation + discussion. In spite of my initial reservations on the format, I ended up thoroughly enjoying it, and felt that it truly made the heavy content of the scientific articles we were discussing so much more accessible and interesting to go through. Midterm and final were challenging but manageable –– just do your research early, and ask Dr Beach if you have any questions! This has genuinely been one of my favorite neuroscience/bio/STEM classes at Harvard, and I wish more classes could be like this. As a non pre–med currently doing research but pretty sure I'm not going to enter the field post–grad (at least not immediately?), it reminded me of the genuine interest I had in research around this field, and I'm really glad I got the opportunity to take this class because of that. If you put in the work, you'll leave the class learning so much without ever feeling like you're forced to do it for an exam where you just regurgitate content and forget everything right after. If you enjoy this topic, want to learn how to get better at understanding scientific literature, and have low–stakes, intellectually stimulating discussions on these papers with others who have similar interests (after all, you all lotteried for this class), this will be one of the best possible neuro classes at Harvard for you to explore.",0.9966,,0.0,,0.0,Auditory Cognitive Neuroscience,NEURO  101W,,2025 Fall,Full Term,2025-09-02,2025-12-03,6:00pm,8:00pm,Mon,17670,Instructor,0/12,0,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,"How do we make meaning out of sound?

Is architecture an art? Do buildings have a meaning? If so, what is it and how is it conveyed? What is the aesthetic experience of architecture? How does architecture determine the way we live and how we ought to behave? Does architecture have a political function? By reading analytical and continental authors, this course proposes a critical overview of the most relevant metaphysical, epistemological, aesthetic, phenomenological, ethical, and political questions concerning architecture. We will also reflect on the intricacies of the discipline of philosophy of architecture as such. We will reflect upon assigned readings by addressing actual buildings and other architectural works from drawings, renderings, and plans to artworks representing architecture.

Students will learn to safely use software and hardware to fabricate programmable projects. Tools and topics will include programmable microcontrollers, 3D CAD/CAM, electronic circuit design, and wireless networking (Internet of Things). Additionally, students will learn operational principles for techniques such as laser cutting, 3D printing, and computer-controlled milling. The course will culminate with an individual final project of the student’s own conception, integrating as many of the weekly topics as possible. The course emphasizes self-directed learning, and supports students in accessing resources to help advance the development of their unique projects. Applications may include personal fabrication, product prototyping, fine arts, and the creation of scientific research tools. Students will document work on each weekly topic in a personal website, thereby finishing the course with an online portfolio that not only illustrates their new skill sets, but also contributes to a collective repository of knowledge that serves as a foundation for continued learning.Course website: https://tinyurl.com/tasr7b6Related Sections: In addition to class times, students enroll in a lab section where they will interact with course staff for hands-on assignment work.

Definitely more difficult than I was expecting, though. The exams were not hard in the normal sense, more just challenging because they were weird, at least compared to other physics classes. It was hard to get partial credit on several problems, and the topics seemed a bit niche. The exam reviews were super helpful in highlighting what would be important, though. Also, there were no practice materials for the exams, which made it even harder to know what to expect. I would not say the exams were unfair, but they were hard to prepare for in a way that maybe could have been fixed. It is possible that future iterations of the course, if taught by Morii, will have better materials because they will have exams from this year to use. P–sets were also a bit weird and sometimes a little niche, but they were not as grueling as I have found for other physics classes, and office hours were extremely helpful.

You will learn so much about so many incredibly useful and interesting topics and your physical understanding and problem solving skills will really improve. Other courses usually just have one huge topic and as soon as you stop following in a week you are cooked for the rest of the class. Since you basically do a new topic every week it does not hurt too much if you do not understand something (as long as you catch up with it for exams later on) so it is a great course to balance some other classes. It really fuelled my enthusiasm for physics again that I thought I lost at college and it is great fun. Above all, however, Prof Morin is simply amazing as everyone can tell who ever took a class with him.

Quantum mechanics is such a cool topic and I'm so glad I decided to skip 15c and take it. I was worried because Cora tells everyone in the beginning ""I'm gonna assume you all took 15b and 15c"" but to be honest, you're totally fine without 15c. Besides, quantum teaches you all the stuff that's actually relevant moving on from 15c without you having to go through the 15c growing pains. It's awesome because taking 143a will open a lot of gates for you: you have more options for physics courses or research labs to join. It's a great pill to swallow. I personally am not a fan of the psets. They felt very computational to the point that I was questioning if I'm taking QM or Math 1a. It's literally pages and pages of stupid Gaussian integrals where you have to integrate by parts like 3 times for one integral. And there's like at least 12 integrals to evaluate on most of the early psets. I think I would've done better if the psets were conceptually challenging and tested my understanding of the material instead of my ability to compute integrals. But that's more of a problem with the book that the problems are sourced from, I suppose. Speaking of the book, Griffith's book is great (a pretty standard textbook) and it was pretty clear and easy to follow. I highly recommend reading the book because it's very easy to follow along the derivations, get lost in the math, and forget about what you're doing at a conceptual level. In terms of pre–reqs, DEFINITELY TAKE LINEAR ALGEBRA BEFORE. You absolutely MUST understand how to diagonalize matrices, the concept behind eigenvalues, vector spaces, etc. Knowing Fourier Analysis helps too. I found my knowledge from 21b transferred beautifully. Thinking of constructing eigenbases, understanding the spectral theorem, etc can help you establish a stronger understanding of the mathematical concepts involved. Of course if you want an even more rigorous introduction to QM you could take 251. But the point of this course is to provide you the basic tools to start doing real physics. There are likely freshman who want to skip 15b, 15c and take this course. I think you could totally do that as long as you have taken 21b/22a. If you've taken Physics 19, you'll find that some things are familiar. If you have zero experience with linear algebra, definitely do not take it. It's impossible to take this course without linear algebra–– you would either have to crash course it or you would be memorizing formulas without really understanding.I loved this course so much and it has definitely made me hungry to learn more physics!!",0.9969,"READ THE TEXTBOOK! And if its been a while since you've taken Linear Algebra, then refer to the textbook's appendix, which makes for a very helpful refresher on the necessary concepts. I simply did not find the lectures sufficient to learn the material, and, in all honesty, I learned most of the material from reading.For the engineers out there thinking that it would be cool and quirky to study quantum mechanics, be very wary of the work that it takes. It is just as difficult as its reputation purports and in the end, you will end up with very niche knowledge about a topic that will have almost no practical application. That said, if quantum subfields of electronics or particle accelerators are your thing, then go for it, but as a mechanical engineer, I unfortunately never see myself using this information except for the intuition it gave me for real–world applications of linear algebra.",-0.202,,0.0,Quantum Mechanics I,PHYSICS  143A,Cora Dvorkin,2025 Fall,Full Term,2025-09-02,2025-12-03,10:30am,11:45am,Tue Thu,10630,No Consent,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,"Introduction to nonrelativistic quantum mechanics: uncertainty relations; Schrödinger equation; Dirac notation; matrix mechanics; one-dimensional problems including particle in box, tunneling, and harmonic oscillator; angular momentum, hydrogen atom, spin, Pauli principle; and if time allows: time-independent perturbation theory; and scattering.",,Faculty of Arts & Sciences,4,Available for Harvard Cross Registration,Physics,Lecture,,FAS Letter Graded,,,,Science & Engineering & Applied Science

Not for everyone in this class, many people seem to be chilling, but from someone who is generally maybe not the brightest physicist let me tell you that for us normal kids it is really hard. HOWEVER, it is doable. I never went to office hours before taking this class, which I definitely had to change. And you certainly need to put some hours in, but no one fails and people care for you, especially Prof Mitrano. And now to the optimistic side of things: Prof Mitrano is A–MA–ZING!!! He cares so incredibly much about this class, he encourages participation so well and above all his humor is so sharp and great that it is a pleasure going to class. He creates a great sense of community (the fact that it's hard also plays into that community–building aspect) and I got my graded exams back three hours (!) after I put down my pen. He also really cares about how things are going with this class, so if something is going harder than you think it should go you can and should definitely tell him right away. And for the academic side of things: I only understood how little I had understood from 143a and quantum physics after taking 143b. There is a reason why the courses have the same number, not necessarily because the topics overlap a lot but because you won't get any understanding of quantum with just taking 143a. I would say I only understood like 70 % of this class but at least now I understand everything from 143a and trust me I did not understand anything coming out of that course. So take this class. If you want to go to grad school or not, it is worth it.

Professor Jaffe is extremely passionate and knowledgeable about the course topics. However, since he has been teaching it for so long, he covers some topics too quickly for full digestion. Reviewing his notes and going to section/office hours can help with this. Professor Jaffe loves it when students ask questions, so it would be wise to review enough content between classes so that you can have questions to ask. The topics covered in this class truly are interesting, but they are sometimes difficult to grasp what they physically mean due to the (what feels like) rapid pace that they are covered. However, this seems to be a good way to learn about theoretical physics. I would say pre–reqs for this class are multivariable calculus and a standard linear algebra course. Some exposure to differential equations is helpful, but only basic diffeqs come up (at least you only need to solve basic ones). Shi is **THE BEST** TA I've ever had. He is passionate and knowledgeable about the topics, and he is always happy to help. He explains concepts very clearly, and he even stayed 30 minutes after section (normally 1 hour) to help us review for an exam. Nicholas is also a wonderful TA and extremely knowledgeable and passionate about the course contents. They both help you a lot on psets if you come to their office hours/section. Exams in this class are somewhat confusing in the sense that you don't know what will be on them, but they are not extremely hard. Just review the material from class, read the notes, go to section before exams, and learn the psets, and you should be okay.",0.9951,"Physics 151 is an incredibly useful class. You should know this material before taking upper level physics, including before taking 143a. However, this teaching staff is going to make the class more frustrating than it needs to be, so be warned.The good side: The material of 151 — Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics — ties together all the stuff you may have encountered in prior physics classes in a way that makes way more intuitive sense. This class finally made me feel like I UNDERSTAND how physics works, which was never the case before, even when I took quantum, 181, or GR. Jaffe's notes are incredibly dense and you will not need an external textbook. If you want to do theory, this is basically required. If you want to understand where 143a came from, this is basically required.The bad side: – Jaffe is 87 years old, and it shows. Lectures are a bit slow, and he has very high expectations. He won't start without someone asking him a question, which I actually didn't mind, but he also seems to expect the students to have more mathematical background than they do, which can feel frustrating because it seems like he's disappointed in us when we can't immediately calculate something. He's also a bit difficult to talk to during office hours.– The tests are old–school, with no formula sheet or study guide, and this is quite stressful; it feels like we're being tested on how much we drilled the formulas and proofs, rather than our understanding of the materials. And the grading is very harsh: many points will be removed for small mistakes (although this might just be our TF this year), and mistakes are double–counted in subsequent parts of questions.– The notes are quite hard to follow on their own. I personally took detailed lecture notes and used them for supplement, and this worked well for me. Be warned that you will need to pay attention in lecture in this way (i.e. focused) in order to grasp the material, because Jaffe's notes alone will not teach you the material.The project is fine.

As an undergraduate, I definitely had to spend upwards of 20 hrs/week on this class (as the syllabus warns) – it is so helpful to read the textbook before lecture, and then the psets themselves are very time–intensive and took me 20 hrs/week. Prof Schwartz's textbook is fantastic and is much clearer than the lectures – I honestly did not take away much from lecture, since we go so fast that it was hard for me to absorb the content if I was seeing it for the first time and also take notes. However, reading the textbook before and then going to lecture just to internalize the content was helpful.The psets are pretty long and there are some questions that are kind of just mind–numbing soul–crushing algebraic calculations. But I guess that is the nature of the material, and is what you're signing up for in the end. However, this class was extremely rewarding for me – it was a very nice culmination of all the undergraduate physics classes I had taken before, and I walked away feeling more confident in my abilities as a physicist and understanding of physics in general. As someone who doesn't want to do high energy, not much of the content will be useful for me in the future, but I still think this class was worthwhile since I got exposed to some really cool physics that I otherwise wouldn't have a chance to see.The teaching staff was fantastic and in general very flexible with deadlines, which is greatly appreciated. The 48 hour final was very challenging for me but I think if you take time to really make sure you internalize the concepts and problem–solving approaches that are introduced in the psets, it is doable. I would highly recommend this class, but my only warning is that you really have to commit to taking it if you are an undergrad. This is not a class you can just cruise through and do the bare minimum – for me, to really understand the content, I did have to put in 20 hours/week like the syllabus says.

I took psy 1 and psy 16 before this, and this class did not come close to the level of rigorous treatment of the field found in either of those. In other psych classes, each lecture will be devoted to a topic where you discuss theories and ideas drawing from many different studies that contribute to the topic, and you come away with a solid understanding of some things you didn't know before and where research needs to go next. In psy 1018, each day is devoted to one or two studies that don't have anything super deep to say. (For example, a whole day will be devoted to a study finding that major key + fast tempo are associated with people perceiving the music as happy.) In fewer words, I just didn't learn much in this class. It felt more like high school than college. To be fair, part of the problem is that the research in psychology of music in general is really lacking, so this might be more of a problem with the field than how the course is taught.– Lack of focus on psychology. A TON of time in this course is spent on things that just aren't psych. The main example is the final project, where you write a policy memo recommending some policy related to music. In practice, this means that most of the final project was spent researching things like: how to implement our policy, how much funding is necessary, how to make it politically realistic, etc., rather than the actual psychological questions that underlie it. I was really disappointed with the final project because I wanted a psych class and felt like I got an HKS class instead! This takes up a lot of class time as there were also some days throughout the class where we had a workshop to work on policy memo writing or poster design – very frustrating when you want a class about the brain and music. To a lesser extent, I have the same complaint about the time spent on things like research design and quality. An example is the day at the end of the course where we debated the merits of several studies on music therapy: useful for understanding *methodological* issues but not *psychological* issues in the field. (Very important to talk about in a psych class, but I thought it was over–emphasized). Overall, this class is really only partially about psychology, so be aware of this if you're planning to take the course.– Assignments. Truly none of them are particularly hard, but there are enough to keep you pretty busy. Here they are:–– Reflection reports. There are 5 of these. You do a short music–related activity and then write a 2 page paper connecting your experience to class literature. Kind of interesting, but you really won't learn anything profound from them.–– Critical evaluation of a media article. It's a 4 page paper where you summarize and criticize an article about music and the mind. Probably the best assignment in the class. Though again, this is about research methods far more than psychology.–– Quizzes. There are 2 of these. It's a multiple choice canvas quiz which is very unforgiving (e.g. 3 T/F questions rolled into one, and you need to get all 3 right to get the point). Requires you to repeat extremely specific information from studies and lectures. He LOVES asking tons of questions about which brain regions have which functions. The bright side is that it is open note/internet, so you mostly just have to ctrl + F to find the answers. There is absolutely no reason this should be a part of the course.–– Final project. Poster + poster session presentation + memo. (The end of the course really stacks up because you're also doing quiz 2 and reflection report 5 in the midst of all this). And you have to submit the memo to a real politician. Anyway I said what I think about this above so I'll shut up now.tl;dr I found this class really frustrating because I didn't learn much, I especially didn't learn much in the field of psychology, and yet there is plenty of busywork.I think it is very possible that the gripes I have with this class are me–specific. For context, I am a STEM concentrator + musician who is maybe doing a psych secondary but mostly took this class for fun. If you're interested in the class you should totally shop it. But my warning is this: if after a couple weeks in the class you're thinking that the class is still getting started and you're waiting for it to pick up some steam and get more interesting, it won't. Get outta there! If you're going to learn from + enjoy the class, that will happen early.In the spirit of fairness I do have some positive things to say!– The teaching team is actually very wonderful. Like even though I did not like the class, I do really like Mayron, Mehr, and Luciana as people. They are all very flexible and accommodating of whatever you have going on, so just talk to them about whatever you need and they'll figure it out. Mayron is actually a teddy bear, he is so friendly and welcoming and always has a smile on his face and brings a lot of joy and excitement about the subjective.– Music performances and activities in class were very fun!– Ultimately it is a very chill class, especially grade wise.",0.9982,,0.0,,0.0,The Science and Psychology of Music,PSY 1018,Mayron Pereira Piccolo Ribeiro,2025 Fall,Full Term,2025-09-02,2025-12-03,1:30pm,2:45pm,Tue Thu,13932,Instructor,0/50,0,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,"Music is an important ally when we feel like celebrating and when we are feeling down.

This developmental stage, known as emerging adulthood, differs from late adolescence and young adulthood in that individuals are less reliant on their parents, no longer considered minors by law, but have not yet fully settled into adult roles.This course offers a critical evaluation of theory and research on several topics relevant to the “in-between” stage of emerging adulthood. These include identity exploration in areas such as love (sex, dating, and long-term relationships), work, and worldviews (political beliefs and civic engagement); evolving relationships with parents, siblings, and grandparents; and structural influences on the transition to adulthood, such as discrimination based on sexual orientation, sexual violence on college campuses, and mental health challenges.

Although I will do absolutely everything in my power to get her a permanent position at Harvard, she is only here on a fellowship contract, so her time with us may be unfortunately limited. I believe that we have zero tenured faculty of Pacific descent at this university, but that is another issue.Taking a class with Therese will not only transform your approach to learning and discussion, but it will require you to engage deeply with some of the most pressing issues of our time from an indigenous Pacific lens. That is a once in a lifetime opportunity. Talanoa, or to talk/unveil, refers to a collaborative discussion approach to complex problems. Through talanoa, we build community, challenge norms, and facilitate understanding. This class was taught using Talanoa, which means that each student must come to class prepared to fully immerse themselves in the week's texts and topic(s). It was an unparalleled learning experience, and one that enabled students to form genuine connections with both each other and the material. Around 85% of texts that we read in REL 32 were by indigenous Pacific scholars. In most classes about topics in the Pacific that I have come across (at Harvard), the ratio is flipped. I think that in itself speaks volumes. Having an emic perspective on Pacific issues is absolutely fundamental to effectively and deeply engaging with it.  I come from a country in the Pacific, and for lack of a better word, this class felt like home. It felt like home in a place that can sometimes feel isolating.

How did they get to be grouped together in a single book called the ""New Testament""? In addition to these historical questions, we will also attend to the New Testament's ongoing role as Christian scripture to consider the following: what does it mean to study a religious text critically? How might the study of the New Testament's social and historical context relate to its ongoing role as sacred and/or authoritative in the Christian tradition? And what are some of the diverse ways that contemporary readers bridge the gap between the New Testament's ancient Greco-Roman context and their own interpretation and application?

I came away from the course without a basic understanding of many or even most of the works on the syllabus. I have a few main points of feedback:– Kojo’s teaching style in this course was not accessible. He very frequently refers to theorists / theories or secondary sources that were not on the syllabus without explaining who they are or what they said (eg performativity theory, Butler, Habermas, Schussler Fiorenza, Asad, and so on). I rarely had the background knowledge necessary to understand those references, and the frequency of these references made the class very challenging for me to follow.– Relatedly, there was very little explanation of the main arguments / philosophical systems of the texts we read, even when they were dense philosophical works. Instead, the discussion started at the level of the texts’ implications for the study of religion and / or debates in the secondary literature about how to interpret them. This led to bad discussions because few people were prepared to engage with the text at that level (only those with prior knowledge) — so students’ comments were often based on fundamental misunderstandings and I (as well as I think most others) typically remained confused about the texts' core presuppositions and arguments at the end of the class.Those were the big issues in my opinion and the reason why I think this class unfortunately did not work. There were some other issues too:– unclear expectations. for example, never mentioning half the assignments on the syllabus again after the first week, until telling us toward the end of the semester that those assignments weren’t happening; or sending instructions for our final paper proposal on Friday when the proposal was due Monday– some weeks the syllabus included too many dense texts for us to give enough time to any of them in class–  I think there was not enough room in class for conversations to form between students without being cut off / redirected.I don’t want to seem overly harsh or negative, because I do really appreciate all the work that Kojo put into teaching us this semester.

The actual course content is interesting, with applications in journalism and current events and media. The pre–set materials also seem well organized, but they weren't utilized much in my class. There are many types of assessments, which can help you show your learning in different ways. However, be aware that there are MANY assignments/projects, including multiple exams, podcasts, and essays. I found this quite time consuming, which was frustrating especially considering I only took this class for the language requirement, not my concentration. Some exams were very challenging, too, at least to me. There were listening comprehension components with strong accents that we had never practiced listening to before. I surely want to be able to comprehend different accents, but I would have appreciated previous exposure during class or as homework so I could practice/familiarize myself––not have to hear it for the first time ever on an exam. At times, the class felt more intense than it needed to be to be effective. Further, sometimes class requirements and deadlines weren't the clearest. Honestly, I think the success of this class depends on the teacher and on the class environment. Especially with learning a new language, you're going to be making mistakes – and that's okay! Ideally, you want a safe, welcoming space where you can make mistakes, accept it, and learn all together. Unfortunately, I personally didn't have this experience. From my perspective, I felt stressed walking into this class. I spent years learning French in high school, and I took French20, but I felt inadequate and far behind everyone else in this class. This could, of course, just be my internal feelings and interpretations; it's hard not to compare yourselves to others when you're speaking a foreign language. But I do think the class culture contributed, too. My teacher encouraged us to make mistakes –– but at times it really didn't feel like encouragement. I felt humiliated when I made mistakes, as my teacher would  randomly call on us and have us repeat the same mistake again and again, as the class laughed, and the teacher seemed kind of amused or disparaging––I'm not quite sure how to describe it––as I kept failing. I can usually laugh at myself and let it go, but this really wasn't a good feeling. It felt almost expected that I would be able to speak extremely well, especially among classmates who seemed to speak near–fluently. I felt like I was stumbling along next to people leagues ahead of me in the French language. But that's the thing!! Everyone comes into this class with different backgrounds, different levels of fluency, different dialects, etc. Some people had even been speaking it from home for years. This diversity is really cool and should be embraced, celebrated, and adapted for! Again, from my perspective, it felt expected that everyone speak at a high level of exactly Parisian French.  The class didn't feel very inclusive to the ability and language diversity in our classroom. And it felt at times that because I was at a ""lower"" level, I was working very hard and putting great effort and time into my assignments, only to receive grades that seemed overly critical at times. I wondered what the baseline for grading was; I wondered if my personal starting level was being taken into account and not held to a higher than fair standard, and I can hope that that was the case.  Grades did become more generous near the end of the semester. Once again, this experience is my own, specific to the teacher and class I had. To end on a positive, I enjoyed when our class conversations diverged into French politics; my teacher created some interesting discussions out of that!",0.9957,"This course was very unorganized and incredibly inaccessible. The website needs to be more straightforward and organized on Canvas and documents and resources need to be more accessible. We never knew when assignments or tests were and our TF never read the syllabus or knew what was going on and couldn't effectively teach us. The TF needs to be more prepared and also always showed up late to section. The TF also harassed and targeted students with different French accents such as Creole, Cajun, Polynesian, and Quebecois.",-0.5737,,0.0,Upper level French : Current Events and Media in the Francophone World,FRENCH   30 002,Claire-Marie Brisson,2025 Fall,Full Term,2025-09-02,2025-12-03,10:30am,11:45am,Tue Thu,12840,No Consent,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,"This course explores the theme of identity and representation in francophone media through various types of media, from the written press to social media, while revisiting French grammatical structures and refining speaking and writing skills.

This course is so dependent on the TF, and there needs to be more consistency between sections on grading or learning experience. I felt like my TF hated me, and he graded our class very harshly. When you would ask questions about course material, you would get ridiculed by the instructor because that topic had ""already been covered in class."" There is little to no preparation for the written quizzes, and it is crazy that an intro class expects you to write 100 word+ essays in full Spanish and then have a TF count off 1 point for every small mistake in the quiz. My grade suffered, and there was no support in class to help bring it up. I even asked for extra work and guides for the quizzes, and hardly ever was granted that. As for feedback, my TF marked up our quizzes but never followed up with us about our mistakes, and I was even given a comment telling me to ""try harder"" after not doing well on a quiz. The department does not care and could only offer 30–minute tutoring sessions. DO NOT take this class if you value your self–esteem or you have a genuine interest in learning the Spanish language.

This course has four unit quizzes and one oral exam at the end of the course. I enjoyed this course more than Spanish 10, it has a larger emphasis on learning Spanish through historical content and cultural knowledge which I really enjoyed.

Reading the Q guide from previous years, I took this class expecting to improve my spanish in a small–class setting, in a relatively low stress way. I came in having some spanish background from high school, but having forgotten a lot of it. While the class was very small (6 students including me), it turned out to be pretty stressful and a lot of work. THIS CLASS IS HIGHLY INSTRUCTOR DEPENDENT!!! Majo, the instructor this year, was very energetic and excited to teach, which made the class fun, especially at 9 am. But she was definitely strict in certain ways, much more than last year's instructor. First, we were only allowed 3 absences, which is very few for a 9 am that meets every day (over 60 times total throughout the semester).  These absenses included religious and medical absences, which was a bit crazy. Also be prepared for the commitment this class takes ... there are nightly Canvas modules, 22 graded homeworks, 5 written exams, 5 class presentations, 5 reports to accompany the presentations, 3 conversations you need to have with native speakers with follow up written reports, all on top of showing up  every morning and actually putting in the time outside of class to learn the material. While I enjoyed the class at times, especially toward the beginning of the semester, the sheer number of assignments became overbearing and frustrating by about the half–way point. I often felt like I was doing busywork that wasn't actually improving my spanish. The best assignments/classes/activities were the ones where we could talk to native speakers and classmates about everyday things because that is most realistic if traveling to a spanish speaking country, but these activities were few and far between the long writing assignments and sometimes long homeworks.  Despite it being a lot of work, I am definitely coming out of this class better at speaking spanish and writing spanish. I am very appreciative of this.To conclude, if you put in the work in this class, everything will work out just fine (you will learn a lot and do well), but make sure you have the time before committing to taking it.

In the recent history of Latin America, there are multiple instances where aesthetics and politics have intertwined in order to create and find new meanings for the issues plaguing the region. If a citizen participates in both the action of being governed and the action of governing, there is no doubt that aesthetics, understood as the formal exploration of the distribution of the sensible, as Rancière would say, is a productive space for analysis to understand Latin American intellectual and political traditions.In this course, we will panoramically explore the relationship between aesthetics and politics throughout the 19th, 20th, and 21st centuries in Latin America. By studying cinema, literature, art, music, and more, the objective is to offer students an approach to how art and culture bear witness, often in a more visceral and affective way than is possible from a purely historiographical or sociological approach, to what politics cannot resolve. We will analyze and discuss Latin American productions based on key aesthetic concepts (manifesto, declamation, performance, documentary, etc.), in order to trace and outline the anxieties plaguing both art and contemporary Latin American criticism.",Conducted in Spanish.,Faculty of Arts & Sciences,4,Available for Harvard Cross Registration,Romance Languages & Lit,Lecture,,FAS Letter Graded,,,,Arts and Humanities

The quality of language instruction was incredibly high and for a language that is so difficult and unlike English, Pani Iryna did a wonderful job with balancing the difficulty of learning so many new concepts so quickly with having fun and reinforcing what we had already learned. Additionally, there were so many enriching things we did outside of class to develop our understanding of Polish language and culture including museum visits, cooking workshops, and visits from past students. Also, the Slavic department does so much amazing programming that I would highly recommend taking advantage of. The expectations of the course are very reasonable and Pani Iryna is very receptive to feedback during the course.

At the end of this course you will be able to speak, read, and write Russian very well at a basic level! I now feel confident to strike up a conversation and can hold my own. If you're unsure just pull up to the first class, you'll love it so much you'll stay!(Much) Longer version:Professor:– Dima (Dmitrii), the professor, is the best professor of all time. Seriously he cares so much, he's incredible enthusiastic, and makes the course an incredible amount of fun. He is the greatest professor I've ever had and should be a tenured professor with several awards named after him. With him, you don't just learn the language. As you learn more Russian in terms of grammar, vocab, and speaking you will also learn poems, songs, watch a movie, record a video, and read a story! You don't just learn the language but appreciate and learn about the culture. – Dima and Roy (the TF) put in so much work and make it so fun and easy for you to learn. Definitely some of the best and hard working faculty on this campus.If you're thinking of taking this course:1) Go to the first day – if you love it like I did, you'll likely stay but please go – it's incredible2) Yes it is actually 2 courses worth of work – see the structure (if you really want to think of it as 1 course think about it this course has around the same or higher median amount of work outside of class as notorious classes like – Stat110, EC1011a, Chem 27, CS 124 – but instead of 3h of class a week you have 8h).  I.e. think of it as 2 classes and you'll be fine since then it's closer to 2 medium classes work or 1.5 hard classes. If you're between doing Russ AAB (8 credit) vs AA (4 credit) here's what to know:1) you will spend 8h of class instead of 5h and do 1.5–2x the work but move through double the material. You learn much more, become more fluent and it's epic.2) At the end of the semester you will know all the Russian cases and be able to understand and speak basic Russian really well (fluency is gained not only by how much time you spend learning but also but in what timeframe, i.e. doing 2x the work in the same time results in learning more than 2x quicker)3) The students who take this really want to be here. They came to learn the language and so people are more focused, interesting and you learn from each otherIf you want to talk to people who have taken the course/are unsure:– Talk to Dr Clancy and/or Dima AND ask them to connect you with students who have taken the course – they are happy to and we are happy to give you our unfiltered takes (which is we loved it but we'll also be real about the amount of work and if this course is right for you).Structure (and to give an idea of what the time breakdown looks like):– To start with the reason you have so much work is because if you do the work you will learn – it's intentionally structured this way. This isn't like other classes where you need to put in time outside of the homework to actually learn. – 8h of class a week of which 3h is small speaking section (usually like 1:30 or like 10:30 or some combo but happens MWF) and 5x normal class every morning. The small speaking sections will fit around your schedule don't worry. Not sure who the TF will be but they will teach Tuesday and Thursday mornings and grade assignments while Dima will teach the small speaking sections as well as the MWF mornings.– Approx 2h a day of HW for Mon–Thurs – Friday you have a vocab test (you should spend like 20m a day studying)– Weekly (take home) unit tests which take more or less 1h– Check your HW and Unit tests after they've been graded to learn from errors– Midterm and Final (Oral and written) – Dima has practice exams which are super useful!!(If we're being honest, even though you should, you're probably not doing it EVERY day, but try space it out, maybe do it in 2 or 3 sessions in a week – DO NOT leave it for one day a week, you will feel behind all week, spend the entire Sunday working, and it's not fun)Grades:– Like most language at Harvard, don't worry – if you learn the language (which you will), you will do well. (no I will not be elaborating but when I say don't worry about the grade I truly mean it because if you instead just learn the language you will do great and have fun).– I mean you're not really taking this course because you are worried about a grade but rather you want to learn the language... BUT this course doesn't have tricks it's straightforward with course staff who want you to success and at no point is there surprises or are you trying to be caught out. Other vibes:– The Russian Students Society host fun and epic events and get to meet and practice Russian.– The Slavic Languages program have fun events like the weekly Lowell Language Table, crepe making etc. The faculty are uber accessible and it's always a good time.– The Davis Center for Eurasian studies has awesome events you should attend to learn more about politics, people, region.",0.9995,,0.0,,0.0,Elementary Russian (Intensive),RUSS     AAB,Jenya Mironava,2025 Fall,Full Term,2025-09-02,2025-12-03,9:00am,10:00am,Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri,12399,No Consent,0,0,False,True,True,True,True,True,False,"An intensive version of Russian AA: Elementary Russian I and Russian AB: Elementary Russian II, covering the same material in a single semester.

And yet, despite Max Weber’s claim that the modern world had become ‘disenchanted,’ the last century saw an explosion of political myths implicitly and explicitly driving mass political movements. Political myth prompts key questions about political theory: Is it possible or even desirable to have a politics without myth? If not, then what role exactly does myth play in politics? Can political myths be open to contestation and reevaluation? Under what conditions can political myth be a means of oppression, and under what conditions can it serve emancipatory ends?

But if you can manage it, this course will definitely expand your perspective and help you understand the structural issues that keep poverty in place. One of the things I loved most about this course is that there are NO EXAMS—just field report assignments, which are only five pages, and the final is another field report plus a five–page reflection on the class. I really liked this because it gave us the chance to conduct interviews or observational studies, which made the assignments feel more hands–on and connected to real–world issues. TAKE THIS CLASS—it’s easy and a great way to learn about such an important subject.

It also examines the parallel sets of institutions low-income people must navigate—institutions that often perpetuate poverty, like low-wage jobs, systems of policing and surveillance, substandard schools and colleges, exploitative housing, and predatory financial services. The course places a heavy emphasis on firsthand experience and learning. We will have guest lectures from people whose work or life experiences relate to the course subject matter.

This was probably one of my favorite courses at Harvard, even though I didn't do too well on the final (sorry Joe). That said, if you're really interested in probability theory, I would definitely recommend taking this course. However, if you're a bit more worried about your grade and time spent on classes, then this might not be the course for you. For context, took this course as an undergrad (senior). Prerequisites: STAT 110 and comfort with proofs. If you have taken a proof–based math course (e.g. Math 22/25/55/112) or a proof–based CS course (CS120/121/124 series or 128), you're probably prepared for the course. There is this question that's posed every year on whether you need real analysis background (Math 112) for this course, but personally I really don't think you need it. It may help as Joe suggests, but you can get through the course and do well without real analysis background. The course also tends to be more probability focused especially on the exams, so I don't think prior experience in real analysis is necessarily super beneficial. So, if you're worried about real analysis, I wouldn't be! You may just need to put a little bit more effort, but there's plenty of students who take this course without having taken real analysis. Joe also makes the real analysis portion of the class pretty self–contained. Homeworks: They're hard, especially the first one on measure theory. They really involve a lot of thinking, which I enjoyed, but it could be time consuming. Exams: Also hard, but there's a lot of practice exams and practice problems in the book, so your performance is typically really based on how much time you spend practicing. Overall, would recommend the course!",0.9887,"Stat 210 is a really interesting continuation of Stat 110 at a slightly more rigorous level and pace. Joe is a very passionate lecturer, so I personally found it enjoyable to attend lectures. This course is more theory–based (although Joe tries to make it accessible to all), and so the first few units of measure theory will be annoying, but after that the content is fun (representations!, MVN, limit theorems, etc...) Exams are difficult, but since they were in–person for the first time this year (as opposed to previous years), Joe does scale the difficulty accordingly. Real analysis also is NOT needed; this was something I was worried about prior to taking the course. It can help, especially with the convergence proofs, but not necessary. The only negative about this course is that solutions to the textbook 'pencil problems' are not readily available (compared to the plethora of Stat 110 solutions available); solutions to the practice final exams were also not given, except for one year's.",-0.46,,0.0,Probability I,STAT  210,Joseph Blitzstein,2025 Fall,Full Term,2025-09-02,2025-12-03,10:30am,11:45am,Tue Thu,13942,No Consent,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,"Random variables, measure theory, reasoning by representation.

K. Rowling). Since my bright–eyed, bushy–tailed days as a freshman, I have been aspiring to discover what truly made this correspondence accurate. Is it the archaic–style of the architecture found in the Yard or in Annenberg? Is it the talent and passion of the many professors, lecturers and students? Is it the things people go on to achieve after leaving each respective institution? Is it the comradery and friendships that are nurtured within the school environment and the boarding house system? All of these are certainly candidates for that which we seek, but I alas decided that none of these really nailed home the conjecture I was attempting to prove. In vain, I hence abandoned my quest. However, little did I know, coming into my junior fall, that the needle in the haystack was not only going to reveal itself, but boisterously become a defining feature of my semester – ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls: I present to you (drumroll, please) 'Wizardry 211: Black Magic with Probability Distributions'.	`Wait a second, that isn't the title of the course? What happened to ""Stat 211: Statistical Inference I"" ?' you may ask. Well, that is part of the trap, because this is precisely what the course wants you to think it is. It commences unassumingly, with a beautiful first lecture on statistical philosophy and the inferential framework; the first few lectures continue on relatively unassumingly, with excellent motivation and intuition provided in class and beautiful results covered. Then the first problem set lands and you realise the true form of the evil in front of you, and from then on you realise that you are better off trying to purchase the Mirror of Erised to survive the assignments than trying to do them in any reasonable conventional manner (including nitpicking AI generated answers, as helpfully pointed out by Professor Janson). To explain a little bit – maybe it is just the nature of statistical inference research, but a very large number of problems in this course involve a 'come up with a ... that satisfies (insert laundry list) of properties and accomplishes ... task' with very few clues from the lectures, lecture notes or texts that give you a starting point or intuitions on where to proceed with this type of problem, so when you are left to your devices and expected to find out from the (often vague) prompt what exactly it is you have to do it could often feel like you are tasked with performing black magic. Like any good school of magic, Hogwarts has over the years perfected a rigorous curriculum to train its students in various forms of magic, and of course has OWL and NEWT exams in subjects such as Potions (Stat 110), Charms (Stat 111) and even Defence in the Dark Arts (Stat 210) to prepare young wizards and witches from taking on real–world threats – it just unfortunately happens to be the case here that taking on the Stat 211 exams right after successful completion of these three courses is akin to what one would feel like battling Lord Voldemort and his army of Death Eaters fresh out of your NEWTS – while it is the case that there are a few Harry Potters around in the course that are able to survive this monumental task unscathed, there are many who have prepared and understood the content well who horribly fall victim to this terrible slaughtering. I'm all for difficult courses that make you work hard, but I am sure that many would agree that whilst this might be reflective of what statistical inference research feels like, this is not an appropriate way to design assignments and assess students' understanding of material.	That being said, this was one of my favourite classes at this school and the best statistics class I have ever taken. Professor Janson is a phenomenal lecturer who teaches with great clarity and rhythm. His lecture notes are equally excellent with a lot of great motivation and intuition given for understanding the tools the class develops and I think coming out of this I finally understood the logical framework of the subject of inference and the big picture of what it is trying to do (in contrast to the absolute mess that was Stat 111 lecture and textbook, absolute night and day difference). I really enjoyed all the topics in the course, but I thought the most well–taught were the areas of non–parametric hypothesis testing and selective inference which I found to have the most interesting and far–reaching consequences; the technicality and rigour was definitely there but not overbearing which was nice as it allowed us to focus on statistical thinking rather than spending more time on real analysis type issues than necessary, while also making sure that what we were doing was correct (unlike in Stat 111). Definitely really really enjoyed it and felt as though it was great at helping me learn.	So yes, in conclusion, a course that is both amazing and very very bizarrely run. You will learn a lot from it, but I am not sure how much of the learning (and especially the assessment of how much you have learned) actually comes from the outcome–based aspects of the course. In any case, I will let you make your own judgement on whether you want to do this, and whatever your decision is, I wish you the best of luck.",0.9992,"This class, which is really only for the concurrent masters students and the G1 phds, gets a reputation for being impossibly hard and time–consuming. I think this is a fair baseline. The modifications I would make to this are, starting with the good: 1) Lucas Janson does a pretty good job of giving motivation for concepts, making the lectures worth attending; 2) exams are now 16–hours long and online – this makes them much more doable since you can go for a walk or eat lunch in the middle without worrying about every minute, but it is still incredibly exhausting. Next, the bad, mostly that the psets seem incredibly unmotivated, with convoluted results that are mathematically sound but are neither interesting nor applicable, and with odd degrees of rigor in the sense that measure theory is hand–waved but some other tiny details are rigorously enforced.

In this seminar/lecture course, students will learn about transplanting functional human cells (such as pancreatic beta cells or dopaminergic neurons) derived from pluripotent cells to treat disease. They will also discover how to use these cells to model diseases, such as neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases, with the goal of identifying more effective, possibly patient-specific, therapeutics. Students will hear about treatments, including small molecules (conventional medicines), whose therapeutic actions can be attributed to the regulation of tissue-specific stem cells that reside in key adult tissues including the bone marrow and brain, but, interestingly, not including the heart or pancreas. Finally, they will be exposed to relatively new work that demonstrates the possibility of creating new cells from old by using genetic methods to swap cell identities. A typical type of question that we will debate is: When should Parkinson’s disease patients be treated with a drug to slow the death of neurons, with transplanted neurons made from pluripotent cells or with a viral vector that produces new neurons from existing glial cells in the brain? This course will highlight the theoretical, as well as the practical, aspects of drug development. How are therapies progressed from conception to patient (bench to bedside)? How can academic investigators commercialize research? Importantly, while this is a science course, not a health economics course, we intend to discuss ways of reducing drug costs. At the same time, we will introduce the new trend of treating rare (even N=1) genetic diseases and how this is or isn’t accommodated within our existing healthcare framework. We believe that students with different backgrounds (biology, chemistry, engineering, business) and at different levels (undergraduate, graduate) can benefit from taking the course and will help enrich the discussions by providing different perspectives on topics that we’ll cover. However, basic knowledge of cell and molecular biology will be needed to understand the course fully.","Permission of the instructor is required to enroll for students who have not taken the courses below.

We will delve deeply into genres of arts practices that could help you to imagine a way forward in your own work. In doing so, the goal is to advance your transition into a professional life in theater, dance, and media, and the identify your key concerns (both artistic and pragmatic) regarding a professional practice. Throughout the semester we will discuss how your personal goals and concerns intersect with political, social, and individual contemporary preoccupations in those fields.  This junior tutorial is designed to organize participants into a community of singular artist interlocutors who can also supportively engage with one another’s projects. You will develop methods to articulate your own intentions and impulses with great specificity, offer appropriate feedback for the stage of development for your peer’s projects, and acquire facility with terms of art in theater, dance & media.  Our semester is oriented to gaining autonomy and independence in relation to your interests. For the first seven weeks of the semester, we will read and explore a number of topics and ideas regarding the development of a sustainable arts practice, all the while, developing a specific set of questions pertinent to each class member’s interests in the concentration.
