Kathleen Coleman is definitely not an easy grader (though she is a fair one), not inflating assignments in the manner that most classes might do.  While this realization was at first difficult, in hindsight, I very much appreciate this approach to teaching.  I think that Coleman's approach could be described as a sort of \"tough\u2013love\" \u2013\u2013 she grades a bit more harshly not to be mean, but to spur growth.  After I got a lower grade than expected on one of my assignments, I met up with her, during which she told me that she gives students grades such that inspire improvement and push one to his full potential \u2013\u2013 an approach that inspired me to learn much more in this course than I think I otherwise would have achieved.  Looking back on this course, I have fond eyes; in response to the higher expectations, all of us students formed deep bonds which I know will last far beyond this class.  Coleman is also an excellent lecturer.  Lectures are thematic rather than purely chronological (education, slavery, economy, etc), though she does include timelines in her lectures.  She delivers lectures in an engaging and memorable manner, making studying much more streamlined.   Assignments are very well thought\u2013out and the expectations are clear (though demanding).  All in all, I highly recommend this class to any student who truly wants to learn about Roman history.
