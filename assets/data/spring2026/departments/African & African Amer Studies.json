Truly a gem, but genuinely an interesting and worthwhile course. I had never taken a class related to chocolate before, or even thought to much about chocolate and its history (like most people), but this course changed the way I'll go about consuming chocolate. Definitely engage with the course readings if you can! Professor Martin is so amazing and knowledgeable. One regret I do have is not attending her office hours. This course is a great fifth class, and you'll love the lectures (most days)! We also get to try chocolates in class some days!","workload_score_mean":3.25,"best_gem_comment_short":"Truly a gem, but genuinely an interesting and worthwhile course.","course_id":"108879","link":"https:\/\/harvard.bluera.com\/harvard\/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=b041430d423d9c2f3e5dbd639e69b2b7795621e6931e0df7430925b40544e8eefa6e344dadfc35bb9205fc609fede5bb&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"}]
