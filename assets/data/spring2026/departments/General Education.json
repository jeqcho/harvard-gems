Reading the fairy tales is super fun, and they are very useful when you can put them in a cultural, historical, and social context in class. Professor Pirozhenko's lectures can seem a little bit dry as she mainly just reads off the script, but she puts a lot of effort into engaging students with the material in the classroom and facilitates a lot of discussion. She also very clearly cares about the class and its content, making her a great professor for this class overall. Bastian is a gem of a TF; you will be so lucky if you get into his section. I unironically was running to his section every week as it was super engaging and fun. Every section hour flew by really quickly. Overall, the class is very interesting, especially if you have time to put into it. The assignments are super introspective, and you will get a lot out of them if you decide to put effort into them.","workload_score_mean":4.09,"best_gem_comment_short":"Bastian is a gem of a TF; you will be so lucky if you get into his section.","course_id":"224850","link":"https:\/\/harvard.bluera.com\/harvard\/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=7dcdb6bac420b02322036cb0318250aa3c400fe8cf3cdb1a020f59fa6c4e15cdbdfe2fc07f8c3fcacb1b3dd8a73b21d6&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"},{"course_code":"GENED 1038","course_title_2026":"Sleep","course_score_mean":4.1,"rec_score_mean":4.22,"gem_probability_mean":0.06,"sentiment_score_median":0.83245,"best_gem_comment":"Amazing class. Yes, less of a \"gem\". But it is simply a little more time consuming now \u2013 NOT more difficult. I think that is the key thing here: there are just a few more components to this class now, but they only check that you have an absolute basic baseline comprehension of what is going on. So long as you are making an effort below 0, it's perfect and you'll do amazingly. Most of the graded components are just following instructions and you'll get close to 100% on them! Super interesting course material and an easy yet SUPER enjoyable class that I am so grateful I took!!!! Katie McCullar is an AMAZING TF. IF YOU CAN CHOOSE HER, YOU WON'T REGRET IT.
