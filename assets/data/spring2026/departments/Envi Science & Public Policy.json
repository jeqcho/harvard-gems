Definitely not a class for \"general interest\" but if you have any background energy, sustainability, etc. this is a fantastic class. Prof. Baker is such a gem \u2014\u00a0incredibly bright, full of great stories, and a great gusto in teaching. The course assignments (weekly discussion papers, participation, and a final project) are extremely manageable and despite it not being a very course\u2013work heavy course, you honestly learn more from it than most courses at Harvard. Come to class prepared to learn (and with coffee since the 3 hour sessions can get a little tough at the end). Grading wise, it's a bit unclear how the course is graded \u2014\u00a0but I think Prof. Baker doesn't want us to worry about grades and rather about learning and being active participants.
