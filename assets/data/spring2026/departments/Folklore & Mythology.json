It's a gem. There are just 3 essays which are super chill. Daniel is a very supportive and understanding person, never makes anyone feel uncomfortable and he takes a lot of interest in what people have to share. The topics are fun (although some of the UFO stuff got a bit repetitive at the end), and it was pretty cool to look at things with a folklore lens. The readings are functionally optional since you don't get quizzed on it during class or anything, but for your own benefit and enjoyment of the class, do the readings so you can participate and better appreciate what's going on.","workload_score_mean":4.18,"best_gem_comment_short":"It's a gem.","course_id":"225907","link":"https:\/\/harvard.bluera.com\/harvard\/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=0ace4d738d5c9a11ed8d0802f22c02e85d2535cdd14d726d2c76287b0aa03ce1fecb625b4e3cd3269bc8496f4a9afea4&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"}]
