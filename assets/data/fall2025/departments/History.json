If you're looking for a gem, then this is a good course for you! The material is interesting and presented in a very surface\u2013level way. If you have a background in history or any social science\/humanities, this class will be way too easy for you. You will be bored, and frustrated at the little time it does take you, and you will feel like you're wasting your time. I wish this same class was taken with a prereq of at least 3 courses in history and lectures and sections were more conceptual and deeper.","workload_score_mean":4.43,"best_gem_comment_short":"***This class is a gem.","course_id":"110285","link":"https:\/\/harvard.bluera.com\/harvard\/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=f58ba5520d073ec0caf75e6b01b67e4b940e8d852890f136704827afbb361066ef53d149c94c48a3911b7527f3aeb28f&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"}]
