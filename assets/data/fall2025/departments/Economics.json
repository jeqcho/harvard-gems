Most students are not engaged in the lecture which can create an awkward feeling when the professor opens up for questions. The lectures themselves are disorganized and hard to follow, which hampers engagement. However, the class was a good review of intermediate economic concepts and did teach me quite a bit about how the EU functions and makes decisions. The midterm paper was really fun to write.Without weekly problem sets or response papers, it was hard to apply what I learned on a week\u2013to\u2013week basis. Section felt like a rehash of lecture and was not engaging. I started my final paper relatively early, but I wrote about a topic that was only tangentially related to lecture materials, so it felt difficult to integrate.Overall, decent elective with some gem\u2013like qualities, but there are better Econ courses out there.","workload_score_mean":4.33,"best_gem_comment_short":"I started my final paper relatively early, but I wrote about a topic that was only tangentially related to lecture materials, so it felt difficult to integrate.Overall, decent elective with some gem\u2013like qualities, but there are better Econ courses out there.","course_id":"127519","link":"https:\/\/harvard.bluera.com\/harvard\/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=20dc33d63c0414ca548775d9498e086ecd49cd190ac2bb99aacc6f576c4326bfae3a51d6b711b40cccad1aa2e3acdc96&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"}]
