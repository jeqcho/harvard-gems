Professor Buckler is extremely engaging, and the syllabus is well\u2013curated. You will be guided through the Russian greats with attention to the history as well as the culture. There was good variety too \u2013\u2013 we watched an opera, a ballet, and several movies to complement the literature. The midterm oral exam was slightly stressful, but if you were reading along and paying attention in class, you would be able to study without much difficulty. I have taken a LOT of literature courses (senior, humanities major) and this one was excellent. It wasn't a gem, per se, but that meant that people were actually there because they were interested, which was well worth it. Give small departments a try!","workload_score_mean":5.47,"best_gem_comment_short":"It wasn't a gem, per se, but that meant that people were actually there because they were interested, which was well worth it.","course_id":"207566","link":"https:\/\/harvard.bluera.com\/harvard\/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=7b9d46f02b93135f3998b7b63ec3f780c1179f9e405cc8844c2bd120e57f0b8a61b08cf89e18c3ad20ec5ee240d8be27&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"}]
