Even if you're not interested in medicine or healthcare, you truly learn so much in this class, as our lessons are very much applicable to things going on today. I'd consider this course a gem, to be honest, but you also gain so much from it\u2013\u2013 especially a new mindset and perspective on the role of race in our society and how it affects everything. I feel like this should be a mandatory course regardless of your concentration plans. So many people will never learn all that we learned in the course of the semester, and I feel as though they should. Professor Williams is an amazing lecturer and he's so engaging. He's also funny and extremely passionate about the work he does. I'm so glad I took this class. The workload was way more than manageable. Your only assignments are really the three book reports due throughout the course of the semester which are only four pages long and really chill. I'm extremely glad that I took this course freshman year. In classes like these, it is easy to feel hopeless and stuck as it seems like the heartbreaking issues we learn about can't simply be fixed by us. However, Professor Williams would usually end lectures with positive statements about what we CAN do and inspiring stories from successful reform initiatives.",

If you have a background in history or any social science\/humanities, this class will be way too easy for you. You will be bored, and frustrated at the little time it does take you, and you will feel like you're wasting your time. I wish this same class was taken with a prereq of at least 3 courses in history and lectures and sections were more conceptual and deeper.",
