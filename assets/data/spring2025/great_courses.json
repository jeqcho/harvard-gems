Politics of Paradise offers an incredibly engaging and thoughtful exploration of tourism, colonialism, and the erasure of indigenous and local perspectives. The readings and lectures were consistently captivating, and the experiential learning component, with its mini excursions, brought the material to life in ways I never expected.This course fundamentally shifted how I think about Latin America and the Caribbean, encouraging me to critically examine the complexities of these regions and the forces that shape their narratives. The weekly discussion posts were a highlight\u2014this was the first time I genuinely looked forward to reading my classmates\u2019 contributions, as they always added depth to the topics we explored.Professor Henry\u2019s teaching approach was exceptional. Her dedication and enthusiasm made every class feel collaborative and inspiring. Thanks to her, I will NEVER look at the word \"Paradise\" the same. I cannot recommend this course enough\u2014it\u2019s rigorous, eye\u2013opening, and transformative.",

        "best_comment": "TLDR: Take this class \u2013 my favorite class of all time! At the end of this course you will be able to speak, read, and write Russian very well at a basic level! I now feel confident to strike up a conversation and can hold my own. If you're unsure just pull up to the first class, you'll love it so much you'll stay!(Much) Longer version:Professor:\u2013 Dima (Dmitrii), the professor, is the best professor of all time. Seriously he cares so much, he's incredible enthusiastic, and makes the course an incredible amount of fun. He is the greatest professor I've ever had and should be a tenured professor with several awards named after him. With him, you don't just learn the language. As you learn more Russian in terms of grammar, vocab, and speaking you will also learn poems, songs, watch a movie, record a video, and read a story! You don't just learn the language but appreciate and learn about the culture. \u2013 Dima and Roy (the TF) put in so much work and make it so fun and easy for you to learn. Definitely some of the best and hard working faculty on this campus.If you're thinking of taking this course:1) Go to the first day \u2013 if you love it like I did, you'll likely stay but please go \u2013 it's incredible2) Yes it is actually 2 courses worth of work \u2013 see the structure (if you really want to think of it as 1 course think about it this course has around the same or higher median amount of work outside of class as notorious classes like \u2013 Stat110, EC1011a, Chem 27, CS 124 \u2013 but instead of 3h of class a week you have 8h).  I.e. think of it as 2 classes and you'll be fine since then it's closer to 2 medium classes work or 1.5 hard classes. If you're between doing Russ AAB (8 credit) vs AA (4 credit) here's what to know:1) you will spend 8h of class instead of 5h and do 1.5\u20132x the work but move through double the material. You learn much more, become more fluent and it's epic.2) At the end of the semester you will know all the Russian cases and be able to understand and speak basic Russian really well (fluency is gained not only by how much time you spend learning but also but in what timeframe, i.e. doing 2x the work in the same time results in learning more than 2x quicker)3) The students who take this really want to be here. They came to learn the language and so people are more focused, interesting and you learn from each otherIf you want to talk to people who have taken the course\/are unsure:\u2013 Talk to Dr Clancy and\/or Dima AND ask them to connect you with students who have taken the course \u2013 they are happy to and we are happy to give you our unfiltered takes (which is we loved it but we'll also be real about the amount of work and if this course is right for you).Structure (and to give an idea of what the time breakdown looks like):\u2013 To start with the reason you have so much work is because if you do the work you will learn \u2013 it's intentionally structured this way. This isn't like other classes where you need to put in time outside of the homework to actually learn. \u2013 8h of class a week of which 3h is small speaking section (usually like 1:30 or like 10:30 or some combo but happens MWF) and 5x normal class every morning. The small speaking sections will fit around your schedule don't worry. Not sure who the TF will be but they will teach Tuesday and Thursday mornings and grade assignments while Dima will teach the small speaking sections as well as the MWF mornings.\u2013 Approx 2h a day of HW for Mon\u2013Thurs \u2013 Friday you have a vocab test (you should spend like 20m a day studying)\u2013 Weekly (take home) unit tests which take more or less 1h\u2013 Check your HW and Unit tests after they've been graded to learn from errors\u2013 Midterm and Final (Oral and written) \u2013 Dima has practice exams which are super useful!!(If we're being honest, even though you should, you're probably not doing it EVERY day, but try space it out, maybe do it in 2 or 3 sessions in a week \u2013 DO NOT leave it for one day a week, you will feel behind all week, spend the entire Sunday working, and it's not fun)Grades:\u2013 Like most language at Harvard, don't worry \u2013 if you learn the language (which you will), you will do well. (no I will not be elaborating but when I say don't worry about the grade I truly mean it because if you instead just learn the language you will do great and have fun).\u2013 I mean you're not really taking this course because you are worried about a grade but rather you want to learn the language... BUT this course doesn't have tricks it's straightforward with course staff who want you to success and at no point is there surprises or are you trying to be caught out. Other vibes:\u2013 The Russian Students Society host fun and epic events and get to meet and practice Russian.\u2013 The Slavic Languages program have fun events like the weekly Lowell Language Table, crepe making etc. The faculty are uber accessible and it's always a good time.\u2013 The Davis Center for Eurasian studies has awesome events you should attend to learn more about politics, people, region.",

Although I will do absolutely everything in my power to get her a permanent position at Harvard, she is only here on a fellowship contract, so her time with us may be unfortunately limited. I believe that we have zero tenured faculty of Pacific descent at this university, but that is another issue.Taking a class with Therese will not only transform your approach to learning and discussion, but it will require you to engage deeply with some of the most pressing issues of our time from an indigenous Pacific lens. That is a once in a lifetime opportunity. Talanoa, or to talk\/unveil, refers to a collaborative discussion approach to complex problems. Through talanoa, we build community, challenge norms, and facilitate understanding. This class was taught using Talanoa, which means that each student must come to class prepared to fully immerse themselves in the week's texts and topic(s). It was an unparalleled learning experience, and one that enabled students to form genuine connections with both each other and the material. Around 85% of texts that we read in REL 32 were by indigenous Pacific scholars. In most classes about topics in the Pacific that I have come across (at Harvard), the ratio is flipped. I think that in itself speaks volumes. Having an emic perspective on Pacific issues is absolutely fundamental to effectively and deeply engaging with it.  I come from a country in the Pacific, and for lack of a better word, this class felt like home. It felt like home in a place that can sometimes feel isolating. This class gave me an anchor, and it (or any class taught by Therese, for that matter) will give you one too.",

        "best_comment": "This class is fantastic!!!It is so much more accessible than what it may seem on the surface. They definitely weed out at the beginning, and you must be serious about taking this class. It is conceptually difficult, but VERY well structured, and if you\u2019re willing to put the time in, you are 100% capable of learning. That being said, heed the prerequisites. They don\u2019t say much about linear algebra, but I would strongly caution against taking this class without at least reviewing some linear algebra concepts first. It is also quite math and computationally heavy, relative to any chemistry courses you will likely have taken.The course staff are through and through phenomenal. Adam is a super engaging lecturer and I stayed interested for the entire period, which is rare. Section was helpful too.The only downside to this course is the lab. Yes, three hours of matlab a week is indeed that bad. The lab staff were super fun and made it livable, but it\u2019s a rough one. You will learn a ton from labs (mainly how to stay alive and not completely crash out for 3 hours while your homemade spectrometer decides not to work). However, some of the labs were only loosely related to lecture, and when you have three midterms, and lab isn\u2019t covered intensely, it\u2019s hard to lock in. There is simply too much to do for the rest of the class.The final project is fun if you pick something good. You have to seek your own help, because they throw you in the deep end. When they mention a potential project topic during lecture, PAY ATTENTION. Those deadlines sneak up on you, because they also overlap with the third midterm. The third midterm was also the day after H\u2013Y weekend, and the second was after family weekend, so keep that in mind. It does feel like you\u2019re constantly preparing for a midterm, but with no final exam, you can\u2019t really complain. Overall, STRONGLY RECOMMEND. You need to be committed to this class, but it will pay huge dividends. Super awesome course.",

I feel that this is a very good but rather challenging class, especially as a first\u2013year. The workload is equivalent to a pset class, as you have a weekly homework assignment that takes time. On the homework, do the extra credit every single time. It takes only 5 minutes but it will make a huge difference for your grade. There is also a quiz every single Tuesday and Thursday, which covers content for the NEXT lesson (not the previous one). Keep this in mind when you consider your workload and which classes you want to take. The assignments are very much focused on reading, writing, and grammar. I came from a conversationally\u2013focused Chinese program in high school, so this was a big shift for me. If you don't feel confident in your reading and writing (typing) abilities, I would suggest taking Ba or Bb if you want a less demanding experience.  The project is worth a significant proportion of your grade, so do not blow it off. If you use it as an opportunity to genuinely learn about Chinese culture,  you will love it!Do not be discouraged if you perform poorly on the review tests or midterm. They are very hard but  there are plenty of other assignments and  extra credit opportunities to help your grade. The final exam is very hard, too. The instructors are all incredible teachers and care so deeply about their students' success in this class. I cannot say enough good things about them. They are always willing to help, and also make class into a fun environment. A highlight was the tea party they had for us. Because I took a very challenging set of classes this semester, there is a small part of me that wishes I took a lower level class. However, I am ultimately glad I took 120a because I truly learned so much and had a great experience thanks to the instructors. Overall, if you decide to take this class, you will have to work hard but you will have a great time while doing it and also make some great friends along the way.",

Both of them have more accolades than I can count on two hands, and they were able to foster a wonderful community in the classroom. The content you will learn in this class is something so special, you will not find a curriculum like this outside of this class. There were 30\u201350 ish pages of reading per week, and an amazing guest speaker would come in for part of each class to talk about their special relationship to music. Everyone in the class is basically a pre\u2013health musician.

This course was great for a variety of reasons. The first was that the materials were interesting and well put together. The organization of the syllabus week by week also made it so the class was always talking about something new and it was well organized to lead from one theme to the next. The papers were also varied in the skills they targeted which made them more interesting to write (a primary source analysis, a film review, a research paper). I was grateful for the flexibility provided in what we could write about for each paper and the ability to guide discussions in class to those readings and topics we found most interesting. Dr. Riegel makes a 2 hour seminar feel like it goes by so fast because of all of the great discussions they lead. They are really good at guiding the discussion and answering questions, as well as including multimedia sources to keep the class interested. I am not someone who is very talkative in sections usually but found myself encouraged to share my ideas and that made this class even better. Overall, a great experience and I would take this course or any other taught by Dr. Riegel no matter your concentration.",

Besides class, there are SO MANY activities from the Japanese language program\/ RIJS, and the class has a great community too \u2013\u2013 I made more friends in Japanese than any other classes. I was a little scared before taking Japanese BA because many people have said the introductory level language classes at Harvard can be a lot, but I think this class is very manageable and fun. I do recommend that the summer before one could preview hiragana\/katakana as I did which will make everything so much easier.

Besides the extremely interesting content of the class, the class itself was an incredible experience. You get to go to the forest, stay in a really nice house, and bond with 9 other students for a whole weekend, three times throughout the semester. These weekends served as extremely nice and relaxing breaks from the rest of the semester, and I still got a lot of work done for other classes at night while there. The group was great and had some of the nicest people I've met on campus, and since you will all share similar interests if you are in this class, there are endless things to talk about with the group. I personally found some great friends in the class, people who I will hopefully stay close with throughout the rest of my 4 years at Harvard. Additionally, as for the class itself, it was the best learning environment I have ever seen in a class. It provided an extremely immersive learning environment where we were enabled not only to be much more interested in what we learned, but we could have a dialogue about each topic and ask further questions about things that were not necessarily pointed out to us, since we were in an immersive environment where our own observations were appreciated and adapted into the fluently shifting yet curriculum\u2013based conversations. We got to see real, clear evidence of global change, learn why and how it happened, and how it can be mitigated or better understood through experiments that were occurring. The content was super interesting and I had some great conversations with Dave and the rest of the class about climate change and just anything that came up in conversation. It really helped me to see that there absolutely is a lot we can do about climate change, and inspired me even more to pursue research in my future. I think I understand global change, forests, and ecology much more than ever before as a result of this class, as there is just so much content, and it is provided in a very digestible and engaging manner.Dave is also great and such a knowledgeable guy, and is typically able to answer just about any question that the students ask him. I truly encourage all to apply for and take this course, it was seriously the best class I had this semester and an incredible introduction to Harvard.",

I was always super engaged in lecture and looked forward to it every week. The course does have a decent workload \u2013\u2013 readings can be long, and there are substantive assignments throughout the semester. But it was nothing unmanageable. The professors make themselves really accessible to their students. The class definitely had some hiccups, mostly because it's a new class.

We had very insightful discussions studying what defines \"Latin America\" and the politics and anxieties that accompany this ambiguous definition. These questions are extremely difficult to answer, but they were able to guide our discussions and make them productive by doing close reading and analyzing a variety of works, including novels, short stories, poetry, movies, etc. I loved the course curriculum and everything we read and studied allowed me to broaden my view of Latin America and post\u2013colonial anxieties while improving my close reading and analysis skills. I felt very safe to speak my opinions in class as the environment was very conducive to the sharing of ideas. I think that the rubrics were very fair and clearly defined expectations for our work. I also really enjoyed the liberty we were given throughout the semester project! I had the opportunity to explore a topic that is very personal to me and apply the topics we learned.

For context, going into the class, I did not know how to write proofs, had some linear algebra background, and was an AIME qualifier. The class was difficult but very manageable and taught me so much about mathematical thinking. I had no idea I would enjoy theoretical math so much. Wes is an amazing lecturer and clearly cares a lot about his students. I heard a lot about the 55 community but I genuinely think the 25 community is way better. Our class is half the size (around 20 students), so everyone knows each other and I've made some really good friends through this course. The CAs are so good and helpful and chill.However, this class is a big time commitment. If you want to explore a million things in your first semester here, you might want to consider a different course. Also, exams are really hard and there is no curve, so take into consideration how comfortable you are with taking timed tests before choosing 25. If you are on the fence, I would recommend starting in 25 and dropping down to 22 if you think its not for you. 22 is a LOT easier but its a much larger class and you will learn a lot less.",

She is genuine, understanding, brilliant, and so incredibly invested in her students. If you have any interest in gender theory or the psychology of the body you should most definitely take this class. I felt like I bonded with my fellow students and developed a real understanding of the material from multiple perspectives. I loved this course, and I feel prepared to use the information in other classes. I can not describe what an excellent learning environment this was.

        "best_comment": "Complexity has set the bar for humanities at Harvard incredibly high. This is the most transformative and enlightening academic experience I have ever had, and I doubt that it can be surpassed (though I wholeheartedly hope that it will). I cannot recommend this class enough. I mean it. I do not know how to convey just how much I loved this course. I cannot be more grateful to have ended up in this class \u2013 it's the best thing that has happened to me academically and I will do my best to convey why it is such a special course.Complexity realizes the full potential of what a First Year Seminar can be. A First\u2013Year Seminar is a pass\/fail course, which means that you should treat the course as if the grade was completely irrelevant. For some, it may mean that you can put in a minimal amount of work to get by. If this is what you expect, you should consider another course. Not having a lettered grading scale offers the opportunity for you to learn for the sake of learning: there is no upper limit to how much work you can put into this course. There is no assurance of \"having done enough\" that an \"A\" offers. This is a class where how much you put in is how much you get out of it. I mean this in the best sense possible \u2013 as long as you are willing to put in the work, there is simply no limit to the amount of intellectual gratification you can get out of this course. That's why I appreciated this course so much. I spent an average of ten hours per week on this course; it is my biggest time commitment of the term. I can say that every single ounce of effort I put into it was worth it. My point is that you should take this course if and only if: 1) you are passionate about the content, 2) you are willing to learn for the sake of learning, and 3) you are willing to put a lot of work into it because you enjoy learning.What makes Professor Fisher and Complexity phenomenal is his willingness to treat you as an intellectual equal and his care. From the very first week of class, the guiding questions were complex and they never stopped being complex. One can build a course based on the questions listed in each week's handout alone. Professor Fisher does not dumb down the content so that you can understand; he presents Hamlet and Ulysses in their full complexity and thereby illustrates their greatness and their full interpretative potential. Each weekly lecture was the highlight of my week. Professor Fisher cares a lot about the content, and he gets you to care, too. I would always walk away feeling ineffably inspired, even if I had spent the night before writing my response paper until 5 AM. The lectures were so engaging and for the lack of a better term, so, so, so intellectually stimulating. It is truly a privilege to be able to take this course, and knowing that this course has ended makes me feel very sad.Professor Fisher also provides very helpful feedback on your weekly response papers. His detailed annotation of my weekly response papers motivated me to push myself to write better and gave me the critical perspective I needed to do so. That alone makes taking the course worth it. Furthermore, I have also gained so many invaluable insights into literature and into what I want to do with my undergraduate years from talking to him during his office hours. Again, I cannot overstate my appreciation.As a cherry on top, you will also be reading Hamlet and Ulysses, some of the greatest works of art ever created. I had no idea what Ulysses was before I started and I will never regret reading it. But if I hadn't read it with the guidance of this course, I do not think I would have been able to get nearly as much out of it as I did; Ulysses is, as Professor Fisher says, a scholarly book that is best read in an academic setting. If anything I said resonates with what you want academically, you should take this class.",

        "best_comment": "Have you ever played Factorio? It is a legendary game of automation. It has such a great learning curve where the more you put into it, the more you learn. There is constant iteration and constant improvement on your existing designs. You lose track of time when playing that game. 30 minutes spent eating lunch are better used expanding the factory. The factory must grow of course. Anyways, like that game, this class is the most potent form of crack you can find at Harvard.

This puts it easily in first place followed by CS61, CS124, and Stat 111 at 193, 180, 172 hours total. In all cases, these times including _everything_ done for the class. Suffice it to say, this class has a HEAVY workload. If I had attempted more of the extra credit and interesting add\u2013ons to the project, I would have easily been able to put in 300+ hours into this class. So, the usual warnings of time management apply here. You might notice that I put in almost no time in the first third of the course. This was, in my opinion, a massive mistake.In the beginning, you will start with a handout code of a couple hundred lines. However, by the end, you will end up writing 6000+ lines of code. In my case, I ended up writing 9979 lines of .c and .h code. Of course there are empty and comment lines included in that, but you see my point. As such, code organization will be very important. For example, your project will need code to parse and execute various database operators. How will you do this? Perhaps consider putting each operator into its own file such as parse_select.c and execute_select.c as an example. Similarly, there will need to be thought put into the load and print commands whose execution will require logic dissimilar than the other operators. How will you deal with cases where you need to find a specific result column from its handle? How about when you need to find a database column from its full name? how about finding the specific entry in the client context for a relevant search? How will you handle database persistance? Where will code for btree and sorted index creation go? In the file with execute_create? maybe a separate create_index.c file? Where will the functions doing the search within the indices go? There is just simply a lot of code to be written. Think about semantic ways of separating your code into different files. If not, your files such as db_manager, parse and execute will baloon to thousands of lines. If using vscode, things like ctrl shift o, ctrl p, and various vim\u2013esque keyboard shortcuts will be increase your productivity. The lectures were very dissimilar to other lecture\u2013style CS classes I took. I was with a great cohort of students and we tried our best to ask so so many questions. We questioned everything and Stratos was great and he encouraged us in that. I think this class wins the award for the most knowledge learnt through slides per word on the slides :D To the point and keeps the focus on the conversation we are having with Stratos. CS165 has the most generous course policies of any course. I want to thus go into a tangent on the many many generosities shown by the class. Both exams are take\u2013home and start at 9AM and last until 12pm the next day. It is open book, open computer, open internet, AND, most importantly, open people! You are able to talk through the problems with others taking the class! Of course your writeup needs to be done separately, but this is the kind of confidence they have in their problems and in their teaching philosophy. I learned so much from the back\u2013and\u2013forth discussions we had when trying to come up with the best algorithm for a task. How is it that the Midterm _taught_ me something? Incredible. The class has almost no deadlines. There is a midway check\u2013in mid october by which you need to pass the first 3 of the 59 tests. This is to give you a sense of the gigantic scope of this project compared to any other class you have ever taken. Beyond that, there is only one deadline, the final one. Essentially, the course trusts you completely and leaves almost everything to you. You make any kind of design decisions. The midterms were fine. There is extra credit galore in each midterm and your first midterm doesn't count if you do better on your second. Nothing to worry about. ezpz. I highly suggest using Ubuntu\/Linux for developing this project. You will be directly developing in the OS that your testing server will use. You will also be able to compile and run natively without worrying about cstdlib functions not being present on mac or windows. Please god please don't use windows.  `gdb` is essential for this project. Specifically, learn how to create a .gdbinit file and create various layouts which will come in handy. A particularly useful layout for me was `tui new\u2013layout <layout_name> {\u2013horizontal src 3} 2 cmd 1`. You can switch to this layout using `layout <layout_name>`. Learn also how to use vgdb to use gdb together with valgrind for a powerful duo. I heavily suggest using tmux as a terminal multiplexer. Learning it and setting it up as I like is has been an absolute game changer. For example, I didn't do this myself and it cost me dear time at the end: create a test execution script that can start the server and client processes as well as can input specific tests into the client. Use the test generation scripts to create tests of different magnitudes. You should at least create the 10million row version of the tests. Then, develop your project only using the larger tests. I personally always used a 1million row dataset and its tests. It served me very well. 10 million is for the stress tests. For example, did you know that there is a max limit size of a stack allocated array? This means any stack allocated array should make sure it doesn't go past that size. This is very niche: the course uses C99 but C99 does not have a address aligned malloc function. HOWEVER, you can create one yourself if you would like. The way you do this can be found on the internet, but what this allowes you to do is to assume almost every memory region you allocated is cache\/page aligned. How about that :DSome Areas that the course could improve upon: 1\u2013 The CS165 language needs to be updated. For example, there are tests that require single\u2013threaded execution. Thus, there is a single_core() and single_core_execute() command that essentially enable and disable multicode performance. Very easy to implement, however, it must be included in the language regardless. 2\u2013 Certain things about the project need to be clarified. For example, it is possible for certain tests to create an internal variable, say s1, and then overwrite it with a new result also named s1. However, at least from my look at the project, there is no text on whether this is allowed. 3\u2013 The create column command specification is `create(col,<col_name>,<tbl_var>)` however, the examples shown just below it show examples such as `create(col,\"project\",awesomebase.grades,unsorted)`. However, this `unsorted` argument is not allowed given the language. These kinds of inconsistencies need to be resolved and not left to be clarified every year using Ed. 4\u2013 Many students including me experience issues with permissions and with the docker container running as root. This is extremely unnecessary and dangerous I believe. If the docker container has any issues, it will execute with root access. My docker container should not be able to nuke my computer :D I mean this is an exageration, but there is no reason to not have a basic user such as `cs165\u2013student`. This would remove a lot of issues with root permissions. For example, after every time I used run_mile with the make file, it compiles the project with the docker root user. Thus, I need to then run a `sudo` make clean instead of just being to use my normal user. I needed to use sudo so much and I find that this is not good practice and makes it so unnecessary. I had input mu 25 char password every time I needed to do this. I seriously considered reducing my computer's password length or removing it entirely to stop password authentication every single time I needed to compile my code after a run_mile. 5\u2013 Some of the section recordings are extremely old and the audio and video quality is really showing its age. I would humbly that the class invest some TF time to rerecord these videos with hopefully better production. 6\u2013 Certain things mentioned in the milestone requirements turned out to be optional and worth extra credit point. The course needs to clarify what counts as a minimum and what not. For example, I later in the course learned that there would be no inserts done after index creation. This meant that I could make many assumptions about my structure. This lead me to design a \u2013I think\u2013 novel way to store the btree in memory without needing a reference to each node's start address. I literally halved my btree size and made it perform much better in terms of cache locality. Final thoughts:There is so much to say about this class, but just know that this class really cares about your success. There were office hours and help available almost every single day. What can I say, I feel that I didn't make the most of this class and I could have done so much more for this class. I am definitely going to implement the project in Rust at some point:D I wish you luck. If class difficulty is not an immediate no for you, then class will deliver. Take the plunge and learn how one can learn so much in just a semester. Like, the largest project I had worked on before this has 2800 lines of python code. Of course, c gets way less done in the same number of lines, but still, this was a big personal achievement for me to have finished this. May you stand unshaken amidst a crashing world...",

The guest speakers were definitely one of the best parts of the class.

Their personal stories really brought the issues to life in a way that statistics and theories alone couldn\u2019t. I also really enjoyed the course section with Kyle\u2014it provided an opportunity to dive deeper into topics like education, low\u2013wage work, homelessness, and housing, exploring how they are all interconnected and contribute to poverty. These discussions were thought\u2013provoking and sparked some truly meaningful conversations.That said, be prepared for a heavy reading load each week\u2014it can get overwhelming if you're not on top of your time management. But if you can manage it, this course will definitely expand your perspective and help you understand the structural issues that keep poverty in place. One of the things I loved most about this course is that there are NO EXAMS\u2014just field report assignments, which are only five pages, and the final is another field report plus a five\u2013page reflection on the class. I really liked this because it gave us the chance to conduct interviews or observational studies, which made the assignments feel more hands\u2013on and connected to real\u2013world issues.

Mickens is a wonderful lecturer, the 3 projects were very fun to do, they're challenging enough to be interesting, but at the same time definitely doable (I didn't feel the need to go to office hours at all). The late policy is definitely harsh, but you're given at least 2 weeks for every project (and in my experience, a project took no more than 2 days to finish, but this definitely depends on programming experience). The readings were consistently interesting to do. The class was still lecture\u2013style so you don't really discuss the papers, but you still submit some observation\/questions you have about the reading assignment before every class. Regarding exams: Mickens has a very distinct exam style that focuses on more conceptual questions (which is very different from the usual exam style in CS 61). On this end, I just wished there would be practice exams, but there weren't any that I could find. For exam preparation, I recommend rewatching lectures and ensuring you feel confident on the topics. There's a final project component that you do within groups of 2\u20133 people, and the difficulty of the project really depends on the topic you select. Overall, I highly recommend this class, but definitely be mentally prepared \u2013 it's very non trivial.",

Overall, I felt the course provided me a strong understanding of the major debates in IR, their evolution over time and space, and a good knowledge of the diverse methods used to answer these questions.

The texts don't need any introduction, they truly are *transformative*, and Professor Wood is incredibly smart and knowledgeable (as are the people taking the class with you). Reading these incredible books alongside others and with such insightful guidance was exactly the kind of experience I hoped for when coming to Harvard. However, I found the format of the course a bit challenging\u2014it's a mix between a lecture and a seminar, which didn\u2019t really work for me. For a seminar, the class size was quite large, so contributing often felt intimidating\u2014like giving a speech with 20 people around the table. I would have preferred a more traditional lecture format or a smaller seminar setting. Additionally, while it was wonderful to hear everyone\u2019s scattered thoughts, the discussions tended to feel unstructured. If you\u2019re hoping for a focused exploration of consciousness or a clear thematic thread, you might find it harder to extract cohesive ideas, as our discussions often revolved around whatever we found interesting in the books. Additionally, the grading relies on two essays without rubrics or structured prompts\u2014you have the freedom to write on any topic, but this can feel risky if you\u2019re concerned about your GPA. Despite these structural challenges, I am so glad I took this class.

As a non\u2013math person, LS50 allowed me to gain an intuition on the why behind some parts of bio (like thermodynamics, chemotaxis, and cell cycle) but it led to psets and midterms being undoubtedly challenging, despite maximizing practice resources and attending CA office hours (make sure to attend office hours, if you take LS50!!).The content in this course is somewhat scattered but it was all quite fascinating as a look back on the semester; I'll go through each of the main ideas. 1) Probability\/stats \u2013 taught by Michael well and was pretty interesting. 2) Chemistry \u2013 Emma is an amazing lecturer and will hold your attention for the entire hour and 15 minutes! 3) Lac operon \u2013 very fascinating and Andrew is a hilarious lecturer. 4) Dynamical systems \u2013 Ben is a great lecturer, but many peers and I agree this material could be removed from LS50. 4) Molecular\/classical genetics \u2013 foundational topic in molecular bio and taught by Emma\/Ben. 5) Yeast cell cycle \u2013 interesting but most relevant for the lab project with Piyush (taught by Andrew). 6) Thermodynamics\/stat mech \u2013 while, in theory, it's interesting material and both Doeke and Michael teach well, this will suck the soul out of you at times and question your will to take LS50. 7) Eukaryotic gene expression\/dev bio \u2013 Kara is such an incredible lecturer and will make you excited to attend lecture! 8) Diffusion\/chemotaxis \u2013 kind of thrown in at the end and confusing, but still fundamentally interesting.It's important to mention that all of the instructors and CAs are warm, approachable individuals that really try hard to support you along the way, despite the material being challenging. I think everyone ends up with an A, A\u2013, or B+ however, this course is a profound time commitment. You will get very close with your classmates in Cabot until 4 AM some nights; you will walk away from office hours feeling like you learned how to approach a problem but must return the next day; you will simultaneous question your decision to do science and embrace the beauty of the material LS50 teaches. Overall, I recommend this course if you have a strong background but you have been warned (for better and for worse). You will meet some of your greatest friends freshman year and encounter significant challenges along the way.",

        "best_comment": "Now, to get it out of the way, yes, this class is stupidly difficult. The analogy of drinking water from a firehose is not at all inaccurate and I would not recommend taking it alongside more than one other really difficult course (like physics 16,CS61 from what I've heard for example) \u2013 it is possible, but it will likely crush you. One other really difficult course is doable if you're very comfortable with, I have friends that have done it, but they were in a position where those courses were very commensurate with their skill level. Nonetheless, despite the extreme difficulty, I would still recommend this course as strongly as I am capable if you love math. You do NOT have to be a genius with boatloads of competition mathematics experience in order to take this class. The highest level of mathematics I ever did formally in high school was single variable calculus and the basics of complex numbers and some very very elementary proofs, and I was still able to score above average in the course without sacrificing my entire life on its altar. I would however say that it is quite difficult to do well in the class without at least one of the following:\u2013 Some experience in high school with more advanced mathematics, especially linear algebra. This is not so much because it will directly come up as something tested in the course, as although we do spend a lot of time on linear algebra it takes a form almost unrecognizable to many of my friends who did linear algebra in high school, but rather because it gives useful intuition as to how to think concretely about very abstract concepts, and a concrete example to reach for when you want to play around with a new idea. \u2013 Exposure to and interest in abstract mathematics. This was what I had that I felt helped me the most. This doesn't need to be formal \u2013 most of my background came from a nigh\u2013unhealthy amount of mathematics youtube videos watched as well as having worked through the beginnings of several lecture notes covering the beginnings of a couple of the university\u2013level subjects I was interested in. These do not need to be directly related to the course material at all, but rather help get you in the mindset of abstract mathematics \u2013 figuring out how to set up a proof, how to see the kinds of patterns and tricks that come up in abstract math, and also just to enjoy the little references to other fields of mathematics that often come up. The course basically assumes being comfortable with this mode of thinking and although you can pick it up along the way, trial by fire and all that, it does help to have it already.With that out of the way, a final couple notes on the difficulty of the course: firstly, although it is indeed incredibly difficult, that difficulty is fairly frontloaded in that it doesn't get too much worse than the first couple problem sets (not that it gets much easier either, but it does mean that if you survive the first couple weeks without completely burning yourself up you can likely survive the rest) and secondly, again despite that difficulty the grading is relatively lenient, and as long as you solve the problems you will likely score quite well. This is especially true of the fact that extensive collaboration is tolerated and actively encouraged by the course \u2013 it becomes much much more manageable once you find a good problem set group to work through it with and the scope of what kind of collaboration is permitted is quite broad. A tip on study groups \u2013 try and find a group with a roughly comparable skill level to yours in the class, as being in a problem set group with someone much more or less mathematically able than you is generally not very productive for either party. This also helps with another issue that I found to be quite common: impostor syndrome. Since many people taking this course would have been the resident math whiz at their high school but are just another student in this class it can often be easy to feel as if you don't really deserve to be in the class, and having a group of people around you who are going through the same sort of thing and have a similar skill level to you can really help with that. That said, it also helps to have a group of people whose skills complement each other \u2013 the joke in my pset group was always that we had the logician (me), the physicist, and the generalist mathematician, and our respective orientations helped a lot with building solutions together; I could often spot slight technicalities that the other two missed, the physicist had very strong concrete intuitions for things and could see angles we couldn't, and the generalist mathematician often had a lot of insights that I was too deep in the weeds to see and that weren't the physicist's style. Now as to the professor. I do not exaggerate when I say Denis Auroux is the BEST professor I have ever had in any academic context. He is a brilliant, lucid lecturer who takes incredibly deep, intricate concepts that I personally would have had to spend many times the number of hours we had to understand otherwise and makes them crystal clear and motivated. He always makes sure to really work through the details of why a result is true while keeping it approachable and comprehensible, which is a terribly difficult balance to strike. He was also eminently available to all of his students \u2013 he generally responds to slack questions within minutes (he's so quick that it's become something of a joke amongst classmates) and his office hours are pure gold. He makes a conscious effort in them to make sure every single question is heard and answered throughly and he gives incredibly well thought out hints. One can also very clearly tell how much he cares about his students \u2013 he takes the time to get to know each of their idiosyncrasies and work with them. He's also just very approachable and willing to laugh with you. The CAs are also as a whole excellent, giving incredibly useful advice on the problems and having office hours on all but one day of the week.As for the content, it is incredibly deep and interesting (although in order to cover so much it is done at incredibly breakneck pace). The main areas covered are group theory (up to and including the Sylow approach to classification of finite groups), abstract linear algebra (with a stringent focus on doing things rigorously and thoroughly, which makes it look very different to the kind of linear algebra many will have done in high school since we don't do much at all with matrix computations, for example even defining the determinant is the last thing we do in the linear algebra section of the course), and their intersection in the form of representation theory. This is covered in the lectures, but a lot of the growth in the course happens in the problem sets. These are generally 8\u201312 questions in length and will unless you are really brilliant take you most of the week to solve \u2013 finishing a math 55 pset is always a bright moment in the week. The problems are very rarely computational and often force you to be very creative in coming up with a solution. The advantage fo this very heavy problem set workload though is tat generally speaking because they force you to become so intimately familiar with the material in order to solve them you generally have to do very little studying outside of just doing the problem sets.Finally, I just want to issue a final recommendation to please, if you do love math, TAKE THIS COURSE. It will be hard, it will eat up a lot of your time, but you will come out a better mathematician than I daresay any other class at any other university could have made you. I can deal with mathematical problems and concepts now that I could never have even begun to wrap my head around before taking this course, and I am much more confident in my ability to actually contribute to complex math. Furthermore, the content itself is just too beautiful to pass up \u2013 you will prove results just in the problem sets that are themselves substantial and will make you wonder at the beauty of math. There are very few other experiences that have made me marvel at the sheer beauty of the thing quite as much as math 55. It has been hands down my favourite course of my first semester and quite possibly my favourite academic experience full stop. If you love math and are willing to really put a lot of time into it and want to beecome a better mathematician, this course will be life\u2013changing. There is nothing else quite like math 55.",

Prof. Goudarzi facilitates a very open\u2013minded, non\u2013sectarian and safe environment to explore the Quran without judgement.  Goudarzi's own research is also groundbreaking in its own right and it was always a treat whenever he would present on this in the class.  Super smart and humble guy! The class didn't have much emphasis on the ethics or linguistical aspects of Quranic analysis which would have been interesting but that is understandable given how jam packed the course already was. Alongside parts of the Quran as a primary readings, the other readings were fascinating, providing insights into frameworks of analysis, culture around different points in the Qurans history, key polemics, and more. Section wasn't very structured for this class this year but the class did not suffer because of that \u2013 I do think this element will be improved upon in future years for sure.

Additionally, there were so many enriching things we did outside of class to develop our understanding of Polish language and culture including museum visits, cooking workshops, and visits from past students. Also, the Slavic department does so much amazing programming that I would highly recommend taking advantage of. The expectations of the course are very reasonable and Pani Iryna is very receptive to feedback during the course. Her feedback on assignments and homework is always incredibly fast, helpful, and thorough.

This was the class that made me reflect on that and realize that this is the first class I have taken at Harvard that made it feel like a HARVARD class, where the professors are both soo knowledgeable, the readings are so insightful, your classmates are very good at articulating their words. I learned so much in this class and the feedbacks on papers, especially the second paper. The professors are both the kindest people you will meet and always open to meeting in office hours. They know how to raise discussion questions, how to direct you toward innovation, and how to guide you. They are both amazing. The papers were fun to write.

There are a lot of classes that if everyone in the school or in the country took, it would do the world a lot of good. This is the best example of that\u2014I think everyone should take it. If you need an elective for Ec then DEFINITELY take it, but still take it regardless of major, because it has so much interesting content and is relevant to every field. You will learn about puzzles\/problems in global health and how people have tried to address them in the past and what worked and what did not, but you will mostly learn about how to tackle these problems and what epistemological issues led to poor solution\u2013development in the past. Professor Basilico is brilliant and will change the way you see the world\u2014I came out of this class a more optimistic person about lots of development issues around the world, and was motivated to do the readings (which are all fascinating and super understandable!!) including the textbook which he wrote which summarizes things really nicely and in a thought\u2013provoking way. You'll learn the methods of lots of quasi\u2013experimental methods in economic research on development\/health issues and also how to read and understand the numbers in those papers, which is super useful in general. They also offer lots of support for the final project, so talk to the TFs and the professor about whatever you are curious\/confused about and they'll be great help.Definitely take it\u2014you will have a great time and learn so much.",

Furthermore, as a white student, I will admit that I was somewhat nervous to take this highly discussion\u2013based course, especially since I am not a student who usually engages with topics of race in my classes. But the discussion culture in this class was really positive! Whenever there was disagreement or strong positions things were always kept respectable (Dr. Rhodes is great at managing discussions) and people often changed their opinions during the course of a lecture. Also, even though the class was technically listed as 6\u20138:45, Dr. Rhodes usually would let us out at 8, so if you are considering not taking this class because of how late it is, do not let that stop you! It also was not bad having a nighttime course and freeing up my schedule more during the day. There are a lot of readings in the course, but they are all pretty straightforward and Dr. Rhodes does an incredible job curating readings that are actually interesting.

Pascale is a FANTASTIC teacher and an incredibly kind, supportive person who really wants to see you succeed and achieve your own goals. She was organized, provided thorough feedback, and made herself available to help.This class teaches you real skills that can be incorporated into many different spheres. It was really empowering to learn things that I can actually use (in my art practice and regular life) and to build things with my own hands. Pascale did an amazing job of demystifying tools and methods that can seem inaccessible and intimidating.The assignments are structured enough to give you an idea of what is expected, but open enough to allow you plenty of artistic freedom. The assignments could take me a long time, but I often didn't even notice because they were so much fun to work on. The final project can be demanding, but was really enjoyable and rewarding! I appreciated that this class is accessible to anyone (coding experience in the class ranged from none to very experienced\/skilled).

This is one of the only classes that actively seeks to integrate and understand available technology rather than shunning or regulating it, and I feel that that is a much more productive way to understand the age we live in. The final project of a digital gallery is also extremely thoughtful as it forces us to think about how to keep research relevant in a digital age \u2013\u2013 surely data cannot just all be expressed in written papers. Professor Pizzorno is also a really supportive professor who makes the class what it is, giving us a chance to experiment and fail, and is genuinely committed to our learning.

Professor Marglin is such a sweetheart, he brought us apples from his orchard every single class, and was always attentive to what we had to say. He offers awesome feedback and is a unique resource in the economics department. Every class we had interesting perspectives on socialism, and Professor Marglin didn't shy away from listening to contrarian arguments. He also did well in selecting the members of the seminar, and if you want a course where you get to know your classmates really well on an intellectual level this is such a good pick. The readings were moderate in workload, but it is a seminar afterall and their all relevant to studying economics.

Having math background is definitely necessary, and analysis and topology background makes it way easier, but I didn't have either and still things turned out fine.

Its culture is so vibrant and being able to connect with others through signing is a completely different experience from talking with someone new. I was in Professor Tomita's section and she was an INCREDIBLE teacher. She made class so engaging and fun and really challenged us when it came to quizzes or assignments. Because of her, I already feel so comfortable with signing. With that being said, you will always get more from a class if you put more excitement and energy into it, so I suggest doing that as well! Practice in your free time, watch ASL videos or shows in ASL, read articles, etc. Go out of your way to find signers to practice with.

Only thing to keep in mind\u2013 this class is definitely technical, and as someone with no law or government background, there was a bit of a learning curve.

I was so impressed by how Dana made the class fun, interesting, and useful for everyone in it. If you have no experience, you will have to put in a lot of work to learn the letters and sounds, but there is SO much in class practice that you can do it. There are also lovely gatherings and outings during which you can practice your Arabic and any level of interaction is encouraged at those events. I had an amazing time in this class and it brought me a lot closer to my Arabic\u2013speaking family; I can\u2019t recommend it more! There is SO much support for you; do not be intimidated by the fact that it is a difficult language. It is difficult, but also beautiful and worth the effort.

It assumes no prior knowledge and really builds up your proof\u2013writing abilities from ground zero. Demarco's lecture notes are wonderful, and the other texts in the course basically just provide further detail. The p\u2013sets are pretty difficult, especially at the beginning, but they seem to get easier throughout the semester as you get the hang of things. I would say the level of the problems was pretty perfect, because it felt challenging and interesting but it really was something that we would be able to do. The CA's are really great and offer tons of OH for when you are stuck. The structure of the classes is that the first half or so is lecture, then you spend the next half working in groups on worksheet problems (usually short proofs). It is super valuable practice and a great time to get feedback from CA's. There was even more practice available in the weekly sections. Exams were not as challenging as homeworks and did not feel too rushed for a class period. All of this feedback comes with the caveat that things may be different under a different instructor, and Demarco won't be teaching next year. However, I think this class is generally well\u2013run and a good introduction to the field if you have an interest. Also, if you ever get a chance to take a class with Demarco, take it!!",

It's a great class regardless of whether you plan to study more theoretical math or not.In terms of content, I would say it is pretty manageable especially if you have some background in abstract algebra (i.e. linear algebra or further) and\/or proof\u2013writing, though definitely not a necessary pre\u2013req. Homework is weekly, a bit on the longer side (occasionally some rather tedious exercises) but quite straightforward (takes around 10 hours at most, and Harris is super lenient about extensions). The main textbook (D&F) and class content align pretty closely, so it is helpful to look at. The final follows very closely from homework so if you do well on psets\/understand how to do the problems then you should be set! My only minor concern throughout is that we get feedback on homework quite late, though homework solutions are posted for reference which is nice. Overall a really good class :)",

Stay involved, ask questions, and share your thoughts during discussions!Professor: Professor Mitragotri is a true expert in drug delivery systems. His deep knowledge and passion for the subject shine through in every lecture. He\u2019s very approachable and truly cares about student learning. You will gain so much from his expertise, but also expect to be challenged to think critically and deeply about the subject matter.Overall: 10\/10 \u2013 This course offers a perfect blend of theory, application, and real\u2013world relevance.

        "best_comment": "This class is very fast\u2013paced and can feel overwhelming at times, but I 100% recommend taking it. When I was deciding whether or not to take this course, I weighed 3 important factors: (1) I had always wanted to read some of the texts on the syllabus after hearing about them through so many history classes in high school, and I didn't know when else I would get the chance to read these texts (2) None of the expos course options particularly excited me and I thought it would be better to spend a year engaging with content that actually excited me rather than a semester with content I was not passionate about (3) I am thinking of being on the pre\u2013med track, for which I would need 2 semesters of English classes, and this course would fulfill that relatively early on in my college experience (as opposed to doing expos now and another elective later on). Given these factors, I felt that I should take this course and I wanted to share this thinking in hopes that it can help other students when making the decision of whether to enroll in Hum10. You will definitely be spending a LOT of time on this course because you have 3 meeting times for this class (which is significantly more than expos I believe) because the reading is very intensive. So that could be another factor to consider when deciding whether to enroll. I won't lie, this class can get out of your hands very quickly \u2013\u2013 if you miss one book it is very hard to keep going and catch up simultaneously. While it is possible to rely on SparkNotes to know just enough about the texts for lecture and seminar, this will hurt you in the end for the final (which is a pretty intensive exam), and you may feel unfulfilled not having read all the books which were the reason you decided to take this class. Thus, I recommend making a schedule for how much reading you will get done and when (since Lectures are on Tuesday and Seminar Wednesday, view your week as starting on Wednesday and incrementally work through the books until Monday night \/ Tuesday). I feel that because there are no actionable assignments tied to reading, it can become easy to forget \/ overlook until the night before lecture (especially when you have a million other assignments\/psets\/deliverables\/things going on freshman year), thus I think this schedule could be incredibly helpful. The lectures are very cool because you are learning from world\u2013renowned professors, but they can be a bit broad sometimes and I feel don't always do complete justice to the text (which is okay given the fact it is only 75 minutes on some of the most iconic texts in history). However, I feel that the seminars are where the real edification happens. It can be daunting to initially start speaking in seminar, you will probably feel that your thoughts\/insights\/ideas are not as profound as everyone else's and thus not speak. BUT I promise, everyone else feels the exact same way in the beginning (we all ended up talking about this in the beginning), and the professors\/TFs are very open to hearing your thoughts \u2013\u2013 they want to hear you speak so they won't judge you negatively for whatever you say (unless it is horribly far off from the text\/shows you didn't read). It's always best to give it a shot and raise your hand, share your thoughts and questions and actively engage in both seminar and lab. I have become a much deeper thinker from this, I found that after the first few seminars, I approached the texts differently and began to ask much more acute questions while reading \u2013\u2013 helping to not only prepare me for the next seminar discussion (and eventually, the final exam) but also extract more meaning from the texts. I have definitely learned how to ask better questions and become a better thinker. At the end of the day, make sure to speak in seminar because (1) you will feel better about actively engaging from the texts \/ getting your questions answered (2) other students may be thinking the same \/ could benefit from your points \/ questions (3) participation MATTERS. To that end, don't put too much pressure on yourself to speak either. The paper assignments can be scary, especially since they are worth so much of your grade, but I 100% recommend start planning early, go to your TF office hours, and go to the writing center so that you can plan your writing around when those meeting times are to ensure you are making progress and on track to revise\/edit\/flush out all your points in time for  the deadline. I also recommend signing up for a hum10 mentor and asking them for help! One thing I regret is not going to office hours of other profs\/TFs, it is a rare opportunity to learn from these acclaimed professors, and I wish I went to OH more often. I hope this information\/advice is helpful in deciding (1) whether or not to take this course and (2) how to approach this course once you decide to take it (you definitely should!)I was very apprehensive initially, but I am very glad I took the course and this is all information I wish I knew ahead of time.",

This was probably one of my favorite courses at Harvard, even though I didn't do too well on the final (sorry Joe). That said, if you're really interested in probability theory, I would definitely recommend taking this course. However, if you're a bit more worried about your grade and time spent on classes, then this might not be the course for you. For context, took this course as an undergrad (senior). Prerequisites: STAT 110 and comfort with proofs. If you have taken a proof\u2013based math course (e.g. Math 22\/25\/55\/112) or a proof\u2013based CS course (CS120\/121\/124 series or 128), you're probably prepared for the course. There is this question that's posed every year on whether you need real analysis background (Math 112) for this course, but personally I really don't think you need it. It may help as Joe suggests, but you can get through the course and do well without real analysis background. The course also tends to be more probability focused especially on the exams, so I don't think prior experience in real analysis is necessarily super beneficial. So, if you're worried about real analysis, I wouldn't be! You may just need to put a little bit more effort, but there's plenty of students who take this course without having taken real analysis. Joe also makes the real analysis portion of the class pretty self\u2013contained. Homeworks: They're hard, especially the first one on measure theory. They really involve a lot of thinking, which I enjoyed, but it could be time consuming. Exams: Also hard, but there's a lot of practice exams and practice problems in the book, so your performance is typically really based on how much time you spend practicing. Overall, would recommend the course!",

They really care about the students (they brought us cookies every week! and when it was warm we'd go outside and sit on the grass!) and they are all incredibly knowledgeable . There are also some amazing guest lecturers! The class really encourages exploration and the weekly assignments are super open\u2013ended. You can do really creative things instead of formal academic writing, and the staff are so supportive of that. Even for topics that you might not be as interested in, you can definitely tie the assignment into something you care about.

The guest lectures are wonderful, and unto themselves make this class fully worthwhile to take. Really cool, interesting, passionate chefs with a lot to share. Including a tasty treat here and there. Just based on these guest lectures, this class is incredible.Now, the other half of the class is \"science\" lectures, and this is the aspect that I feel is most lacking. It basically feels like a high school science class. Very formulaic, not very well connected with the guest lectures. Abstractly the \"science\" they teach you is motivated by the lectures, but it is not science that will in any significant way help you cook better. Perhaps this is a necessary sacrifice to be able to offer this as a gened, but I personally got very little out of the \"science\" lectures. Admittedly I do have a science background, but I think even so, this statement stands.The labs were ok \u2013\u2013 often quite tasty, but also often fairly disconnected from the actual class. The guest lecturers would share so much interesting information, offer a demonstration or two, and then it would be disappointing to almost entirely ignore what they shared when we went to lab. The assignments were generally fine, though often there would be some mediocrely written questions that would somehow find their way through. ie questions that were not actually solvable given the material taught in the class, or that were ambiguously formulated in a way that didn't really suggest a way to solve. However, while this was a nuisance at times, it was nothing too unbearable. I think the qualm I shared generally do make the course less stressful than it would otherwise be, which may be an advantage in that regards, and so if you solely take this course for the guest lectures you will be well served! But I don't think I would recommend taking this class solely for its \"science\" lectures. Nonetheless, on the whole, very fun class, very cool experience.",

I took psy 1 and psy 16 before this, and this class did not come close to the level of rigorous treatment of the field found in either of those. In other psych classes, each lecture will be devoted to a topic where you discuss theories and ideas drawing from many different studies that contribute to the topic, and you come away with a solid understanding of some things you didn't know before and where research needs to go next. In psy 1018, each day is devoted to one or two studies that don't have anything super deep to say. (For example, a whole day will be devoted to a study finding that major key + fast tempo are associated with people perceiving the music as happy.) In fewer words, I just didn't learn much in this class. It felt more like high school than college. To be fair, part of the problem is that the research in psychology of music in general is really lacking, so this might be more of a problem with the field than how the course is taught.\u2013 Lack of focus on psychology. A TON of time in this course is spent on things that just aren't psych. The main example is the final project, where you write a policy memo recommending some policy related to music. In practice, this means that most of the final project was spent researching things like: how to implement our policy, how much funding is necessary, how to make it politically realistic, etc., rather than the actual psychological questions that underlie it. I was really disappointed with the final project because I wanted a psych class and felt like I got an HKS class instead! This takes up a lot of class time as there were also some days throughout the class where we had a workshop to work on policy memo writing or poster design \u2013 very frustrating when you want a class about the brain and music. To a lesser extent, I have the same complaint about the time spent on things like research design and quality. An example is the day at the end of the course where we debated the merits of several studies on music therapy: useful for understanding *methodological* issues but not *psychological* issues in the field. (Very important to talk about in a psych class, but I thought it was over\u2013emphasized). Overall, this class is really only partially about psychology, so be aware of this if you're planning to take the course.\u2013 Assignments. Truly none of them are particularly hard, but there are enough to keep you pretty busy. Here they are:\u2013\u2013 Reflection reports. There are 5 of these. You do a short music\u2013related activity and then write a 2 page paper connecting your experience to class literature. Kind of interesting, but you really won't learn anything profound from them.\u2013\u2013 Critical evaluation of a media article. It's a 4 page paper where you summarize and criticize an article about music and the mind. Probably the best assignment in the class. Though again, this is about research methods far more than psychology.\u2013\u2013 Quizzes. There are 2 of these. It's a multiple choice canvas quiz which is very unforgiving (e.g. 3 T\/F questions rolled into one, and you need to get all 3 right to get the point). Requires you to repeat extremely specific information from studies and lectures. He LOVES asking tons of questions about which brain regions have which functions. The bright side is that it is open note\/internet, so you mostly just have to ctrl + F to find the answers. There is absolutely no reason this should be a part of the course.\u2013\u2013 Final project. Poster + poster session presentation + memo. (The end of the course really stacks up because you're also doing quiz 2 and reflection report 5 in the midst of all this). And you have to submit the memo to a real politician. Anyway I said what I think about this above so I'll shut up now.tl;dr I found this class really frustrating because I didn't learn much, I especially didn't learn much in the field of psychology, and yet there is plenty of busywork.I think it is very possible that the gripes I have with this class are me\u2013specific. For context, I am a STEM concentrator + musician who is maybe doing a psych secondary but mostly took this class for fun. If you're interested in the class you should totally shop it. But my warning is this: if after a couple weeks in the class you're thinking that the class is still getting started and you're waiting for it to pick up some steam and get more interesting, it won't. Get outta there! If you're going to learn from + enjoy the class, that will happen early.In the spirit of fairness I do have some positive things to say!\u2013 The teaching team is actually very wonderful. Like even though I did not like the class, I do really like Mayron, Mehr, and Luciana as people. They are all very flexible and accommodating of whatever you have going on, so just talk to them about whatever you need and they'll figure it out. Mayron is actually a teddy bear, he is so friendly and welcoming and always has a smile on his face and brings a lot of joy and excitement about the subjective.\u2013 Music performances and activities in class were very fun!\u2013 Ultimately it is a very chill class, especially grade wise.",

This class is ENTIRELY based around learning different experimental methods and knowing when to apply them. It is super important to gain a good understanding of all of these methods early on or you will get really lost. While this is a difficult course, it is super rewarding and the content covered in lecture is really interesting. There is a really good mix of lecture content and the experiments covered in class are really cool. There is also an interesting ethical component which encourages students to think critically about the ethics behind these experiments. If you take SCRB10, please, please, please master the experimental methods and do NOT focus on memorizing the specific pathways.",
