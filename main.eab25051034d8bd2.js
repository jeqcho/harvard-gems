There are also concepts that come from human anatomy (either in papers like epidermal wounds, leukemia modeling, cardiac electrophysiology) that are introduced through a mathematical lens and changed my way of viewing processes like heartbeats, healing, and medication.Lecture: Honestly it is so useful when it comes to reviewing the steps you need to approach in solving a problem set question. Go to every class and write down everything Wes puts on the board, even if it takes a minute to understand. It might click as you work through problems.Problem sets: They\'re only once a week, which is so much better than Math 21a and 21b. If you\'re between this class and Math 22a or 22b, I\'d select 19a if you don\'t have experience with proofs. Also office hours were helpful because the TFs are patient and will guide you as you approach questions. Show up even if you barely started.Exams: It\'s nice that there are only two. It\'s scary that they cover so much content. One thing that caught me off guard is that your understanding of the readings is also asked. It\'s nothing tricky or too specific. If you take notes while Todd presents the key points in the article and later review his lecture slides (which contain more notes on Canvas) then you\'ll be ready. As for the math portion, make sure you know the rationale behind what certain topics are and not just the steps, because some questions will not be so simple as to just memorize the steps and write them down.Final Project: Start early!! Your proposal is due sometime in mid\u2013October. If you\'re learning about a certain concept in LS1a, LPS A, or another life sciences adjacent class, pick your favorite and find some math behind it. This way, it feels more interesting as you learn more and study for your other class. As long as you begin graphing models (at least one graph) before Thanksgiving break and continue before/throughout reading period, you\'ll be fine.Always reach out to Wes! He\'s a great person to talk to and genuinely is rooting for everyone\'s success. If his office hours don\'t work for you, reach out for an appointment!

This was the most well\u2013thought out, well\u2013planned, course I have ever taken. You will be amazed at how much you learn each week. The quality and joy for learning that Kageyama sensei and our awesome TFs nurtured throughout lecture and section was truly incredible. Another important aspect of the course to note is that there is an abundance of additional resources that perfectly align with the course on the Canvas page. Take advantage of them! The textbook and accompanying app for audio (you can download it for free) matched lecture perfectly and were excellently prepared as well. I have never felt so supported in a course and unlike other courses where the book or reference material doesn\'t match class, all the units are very systematic and if you ever get confused or need clarification, the book is guaranteed to have the answers to your questions. The course staff also holds \\"Nihongo Chat Hours\\" every week if you want more practice speaking or just one\u2013on\u2013one time to review. The course is one you need to dedicate time to, but it will be a rewarding and fun experience.

Chem major or not (if you need to take orgo for pre\u2013med for example), take this class!! Professor Myers is a wonderful lecturer and the teaching staff is great. This course is definitely difficult and will require a lot of your time. There\'s no getting around that. There\'s a lot of material covered and Professor Myers often goes through lectures at a very fast pace (to the point where if someone asks a question, he either advises them to speak with him after class or answers the question but we stay 2\u20133 min late after class because there is just no time). The teaching style worked very well for me, it was a traditional \\"professor lectures at the board for 75 min and you take notes\\" which I\'m used to and sections were great for catching anything I didn\'t quite get in class. Though Professor Myers may seem intimidating, he really isn\'t and genuinely wants to get to know students and just teach fun things in organic chemistry. Problem sets were certainly difficult and you can\'t do them without going to office hours. But it\'s usually manageable to complete the whole pset after 1  two\u2013hour office hour session if you start the pset beforehand and only come to office hours with questions. I can\'t speak to how helpful the PSLs are since I didn\'t go to their office hours after unhelpful experiences in chem 20, but TF office hours were extremely helpful. The teaching staff in general is very supportive and receptive to questions. Exams were sometimes fair, sometimes pretty difficult. You definitely need to study hard for them and you should probably make peace with simply letting the rest of your life take a backseat the 5\u20137 days before exams. There is however an alternative grading scheme which drops your lowest exam and replaces it with your final exam score which can help if you had a rough time with one of the exams (this was Exam 3 for most people this semester).  Lecture Integration problems were great for reviewing material that was covered recently and keeping it fresh, and they\'re basically free points (add up to an extra pset grade and they\'re grade based on completion) so do them!! Also PLEASE go to review sessions! They are \\"optional\\" in the syllabus (attendance isn\'t checked) but they are so great for reviewing the material and working on problems to really cement your understanding of the material. Professor Myers takes time out of his schedule to host the review sessions and works through the problems with students at the board which is incredibly helpful ( a little embarrassing sometimes if you are standing at the board for 20 minutes as your synthesis is being reworked, but SO helpful!!). Exam questions are also sometimes pulled STRAIGHT from the review session packets so at the very least go to them to be prepared for potential exam questions. The final was very fair (this year and in years prior since previous finals are given to us as practice finals) and I feel like represented the course material and the class itself quite well. You have to study a lot and put the work in, but it is certainly possible to get very high grades on exams and psets and be very successful in the class. Lab was alright, 4 hours is tough but the TFs tried to make labs fun and also get us out early which was very very appreciated and made the experience much better than it could have been.

You are left with very important and fundamental proofs done in class or in problem sets or reviewed in the textbook. It is also strongly recommended to LaTeX your psets, which is very helpful when reviewing the psets for the midterms or the final exam, but also takes a lot of time (in my experience, about 5\u20136 per week). The class is VERY well put together and structured. All the problems have a meaning behind and will probably be useful at some later time in the course (go to Wes\'s office hours to learn the \\"meaning\\" of each problem).  The reading, unlike other classes, are straightforward and helpful. The lecture notes are too! I strongly recommend not skipping lecture, even though it\'s a 3 times per week 9am class, since not all lecture videos are uploaded, and by actively participating you learn a lot easier. Also, it is pretty easy to get left behind if you don\'t attend lectures. One thing that I did not like were the solutions to the psets, which were not quite useful, because they were skipping a lot of steps, and not giving proper explanations. Another thing I really liked was Wes\'s openness. He was very supportive after the first midterm, and did not release the mean of the exam, which was emotionally helpful for the students\'s sake. He really emphasized self growth, which I have rarely seen in teachers. I strongly recommend going to his office hours if possible. They are not that useful for solving the pset problems, but for understanding class material, and its usefulness in other areas (Wes is an applied mathematician and gives many examples for applicability of linear algebra).  Also, you get to build a connection with a wonderful faculty member.

It\'s a really interesting continuation of the topics that Stat 110 covers but in greater depth and rigor. Reasoning by representation (e.g, proving results by connecting different distributions) is really powerful and interesting, and the measure theoretic foundation that Stat 210 provides makes probability (at least in my opinion) more intuitive but also more rigorous. Problem sets are fair and interesting, and exams are reasonable (the midterm was fair, and the final felt generous \u2013 I know it\'s been a bit harder in previous years though).Overall, the course feels more like an upper\u2013level undergraduate class compared to a graduate class \u2013 both in content and in enrollment. From what I know, for better or for worse, the course differs a bit from other schools\' graduate probability classes: it\'s less focused on measure theory (e.g., spends less time on rigorous constructions of parts of probability) and more focused on providing intuitive results and explanations. It also at times awkwardly balances between doing analysis (e.g., when proving the CLT) and not doing analysis (e.g., handwaving parts of measure theory and MGFs). I\'d definitely still recommend taking some form of analysis before this class \u2013 the class is definitely doable without it, but Math 25/55/112 or equivalent makes the course much more understandable (especially when it comes to topics like CLTs and LLNs). Also, taking Math 114 at the same time as this course is underrated \u2013 it makes the measure theory parts of this course so much more understandable, and depending on who teaches Math 114, it\'ll make the end of that class a whole lot easier too.Last bit because I would\'ve liked to have a review like this when I was looking at the QGuide: I self\u2013studied Stat 110 over the summer by watching the Youtube lectures, doing the psets, and reading the textbook \u2013 in the end, I felt really well\u2013prepared for Stat 210, and I think that it was a good move to take Stat 210. I came from a Math 25 background, and even though Stat 210 can be/sound a little intimidating, it\'s definitely doable, and if you already know some probability and like analysis, it\'s a jump worth considering. On the flip side, if your Stat 110 knowledge isn\'t fairly solid or you\'re not too confident in basic probability, Stat 210 will be a bit challenging. After a few lectures on measure theory, the class dives into reasoning by representation; if you\'re shaky on probability distributions, this (large) section and foundation of the course won\'t be very fun.","best_comment_short":"Also, taking Math 114 at the same time as this course is underrated \u2013 it makes the measure theory parts of this course so much more understandable, and depending on who teaches Math 114, it\'ll make the end of that class a whole lot easier too.Last bit because I would\'ve liked to have a review like this when I was looking at the QGuide: I self\u2013studied Stat 110 over the summer by watching the Youtube lectures, doing the psets, and reading the textbook \u2013 in the end, I felt really well\u2013prepared for Stat 210, and I think that it was a good move to take Stat 210.","best_comment_first":"If you liked Stat 110 (especially thinking about different distributions and how they relate to one another), you\'ll probably also like Stat 210.","course_id":"111696","link":"https://harvard.bluera.com/harvard/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=4b53dd1d38e663e3a552990b6a0f0aa075335f9bd3c031b2a18fbbf4dece907b173da13ff4b62adcb210e30bc0e37fe7&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"},{"course_code":"HIST 82F","useful_title":"The Origins of the Cold War The Yalta Conference (1945)","course_score_mean":4.43,"rec_score_mean":4.21,"gem_score_mean":0,"sentiment_score_median":0.91065,"best_gem_comment":"","workload_score_mean":6.62,"best_gem_comment_short":"","best_comment":"This is a truly fantastic course.

This is likely due to the immersive and hands\u2013on nature of the class, which made it feel like I was really learning in a meaningful way.One of the best things about this class is its convenience and proximity to the quad. It was easy to fit into my schedule and attend regularly, which allowed me to make the most of the class. The workload was also manageable, with only a couple of short assignments to complete in addition to the dancing.Overall, I would say that Gaga dance class is a must\u2013take if you are in the quad area.

The material is engaging, it isn\'t easy given the higher level concepts, but it definitely is doable alongside other difficult classes.  The weekly work felt a little relentless possibly because OH were scheduled right before the work was due most of the time, so we all ended up cramming a lot of the work into the day before due dates, but the grading is nice, and getting an A is certainly not out of reach for most people. Just pay attention in class, don\'t get distracted on your computer, go to section, and take advantage of the time with the great course staff! Shubham, Manos, and Demba are gems and this class was fantastic.  Sometimes the psets got a little disorienting because it felt like we had never seen the material before, but looking back, they were so helpful in seeing how the concepts are applied.

Tracey is the goat fr fr, she straight up does not miss. If you\u2019re like me, then this class is going to go from very good to phenomenal. If you aren\u2019t (totally fine!), it might go to good.This class is very theory heavy while still being grounded. There\u2019s a lot of psychoanalysis, a lot of neoliberalism, some marx, a good amount of sociological theory, etc\u2026 Im very theory pilled, so I loved the readings, but if you aren\u2019t, it might not be the class for you BUT at the same time Tracey helps orient theoretical discussions around the actual happenings of the world, which keeps things grounded and present. I don\u2019t mean to make it sound all theory (it really isn\u2019t!!!), but it\u2019s definitely the most theoretical class I\u2019ve had that still ostensibly about ethnographies and studying particular societal trends.The class is about entrepreneurialism in the loosest of senses. We read about entrepreneurialism in the first week, then we never really discussed it again (which I honestly didn\u2019t mind one bit.) It\u2019s really a class about identity formation under capitalism. And, as mentioned, it is also very theoretical, so ideally for people who like theory and like Freud, Foucault, Butler, etc\u2026 I will also say that though the more theoretical texts DO connect with the more ethnographic readings (which come mainly in the second half) the connections are not always explicitly drawn. My personal only real complaint is that in class presentations from other students were quite long. TLDR; Tracey is a great great teacher, if you like studying theory, psychoanalysis, identity formation, and capitalism as not just an economic system, it\u2019ll probably be a GOAT class, if you don\u2019t, probably still quite good, but know what you\u2019re getting into.","best_comment_short":"And, as mentioned, it is also very theoretical, so ideally for people who like theory and like Freud, Foucault, Butler, etc\u2026 I will also say that though the more theoretical texts DO connect with the more ethnographic readings (which come mainly in the second half) the connections are not always explicitly drawn.","best_comment_first":"This class (or any future class that Tracey is teaching) is objectively very good!","course_id":"220409","link":"https://harvard.bluera.com/harvard/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=11971f01d5c15736074ee396aad46ba8390edfafc8f1888f13749b5b120edc651fa87fce4777c0bee34888dec8292b90&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"},{"course_code":"WSTAFRCN AA","useful_title":"Elementary West African Pidgin","course_score_mean":4.14,"rec_score_mean":4.64,"gem_score_mean":0,"sentiment_score_median":0.7177,"best_gem_comment":"","workload_score_mean":2.77,"best_gem_comment_short":"","best_comment":"I highly recommend this course!

You develop a much better understanding of empirical study design, IVs, discrete choice models. This course is organized in a really satisfying way which feels a little different from other ec electives I\'ve taken. Most of the meat of the course is in learning about empirical research and study design. Therefore, the class is organized more around discussing tons of different recent empirical papers, rather than learning a ton of theory and maybe reading one or two empirical papers.

The second major thing I learned is how to understand and react to weekly macroeconomic and financial markets changes: things like new data releases on inflation, the JOLTS survey, BLS data, etc. I most appreciated the opportunity to sit in on Larry\'s teaching and hear him reason through all the current macro bombs that happened each week, the broader macro questions we were asking, his work on secular stagnation, his take/explanation on the papers of others, and his live feedback to the students that presented almost every week. This constant exercise of hearing Larry speak and reason through his thoughts and analogies was the MOST valuable takeaway from this course, and would not be received in any other economics experience elsewhere. It was a great privilege to get such constant, consistent, and timely live feedback from Larry and Paul on our presentations, as well as to have them advise us on one paper that we are working towards throughout the entire semester. The weekly student presentations on the papers we read were important as students should have a frequent exercise in the presentation of academic papers; it enforces close engagement with the material, solidifies understanding, and points out areas of confusion. However, most of the papers were over our heads, and it is certain that most students did not have a strong understanding of the academic papers. I wish we had more pedagogical experiences learning to understand these papers from Larry and Paul, after students presented, instead of us trying to make sense of the papers (often the blind leading the blind). If we could increase paper understanding to 80%+, then that would be an incredible achievement and benefit to future students. Lastly, like my peers have said, this course would benefit from an equalization of the floor at the onset of the class by having Larry and Paul teach about foundational macro finance principals in the first few weeks. The students that were not in FED challenge or did not have the privileges of joining FED challenge had a harder learning curve to makeup.","best_comment_short":"It was a great privilege to get such constant, consistent, and timely live feedback from Larry and Paul on our presentations, as well as to have them advise us on one paper that we are working towards throughout the entire semester.","best_comment_first":"To me, one of the most unique and important things I gained from this course is how to think about and explain complex problems with immediately understandable analogies\u2013\u2013this is perhaps the most important general learning tool I have taken away, and it is one of the key hallmarks of Larry\'s wit and brilliance.","course_id":"217408","link":"https://harvard.bluera.com/harvard/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=a92c0bae13a5cd87339ae03f91a35f29f79443a30c3b4ba994b0cfb5b91ad29cbf09669b938837d947c4b6a6e7a8bcba&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"},{"course_code":"MUSIC 107","useful_title":"Advanced Ensembles","course_score_mean":5,"rec_score_mean":5,"gem_score_mean":0,"sentiment_score_median":0.6105,"best_gem_comment":"","workload_score_mean":3.13,"best_gem_comment_short":"","best_comment":"Great course if you are in jazz band \u2013 doesn\'t add a ton of work to your plate and is a good way to learn more about what you are playing within the ensemble.","best_comment_short":"Great course if you are in jazz band \u2013 doesn\'t add a ton of work to your plate and is a good way to learn more about what you are playing within the ensemble.","best_comment_first":"Great course if you are in jazz band \u2013 doesn\'t add a ton of work to your plate and is a good way to learn more about what you are playing within the ensemble.","course_id":"220622","link":"https://harvard.bluera.com/harvard/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=7a7503d91fa136fb70c79747c790085df74f127cf154c7bf70620817ea74e260f914c79148e392fa1158efc77f918df8&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"},{"course_code":"EXPOS 10","useful_title":"Introduction to Expository Writing","course_score_mean":4.56,"rec_score_mean":4.33,"gem_score_mean":0,"sentiment_score_median":0.5106,"best_gem_comment":"","workload_score_mean":6.22,"best_gem_comment_short":"","best_comment":"Take this class only if you feel uncomfortable with writing.

If you\'re thinking about taking the course, do it! Find some friends to take it with you, clear space in your schedule, and deep dive into the course. It\'s definitely worth it; don\'t be deterred by any reviews. A few reasons the class stands out:1) Stratos and his lab are some of the most chill, yet cracked people I\'ve ever met\u2014just look at the awards they win. This translates to easy\u2013to\u2013understand lectures and a good introduction to research. Lectures teach you how to walk step\u2013by\u2013step through the different operators you learn about, as well as how to break down any high\u2013level database concept into the fundamentals: cache utilization, branching, etc. (I would suggest taking CS 61 before this course; I will note that I found the project easier than the psets in CS 61). Furthermore, doing database research is comparable to the work you do in lectures.2) You learn how to code\u2014independently. Unlike in CS 61, where the projects were contained to 1\u20132 weeks of work, no one besides you in this class (not the TFs nor Stratos) will know your entire database implementation because you\'ll be working on it throughout the semester. Besides the handout code\u2014which you can revamp to your heart\'s content\u2014you decide which functions to create and how they work, how to parse inputs, and how to return results. Attending lectures should provide a rough outline for you to follow, but besides that, you learn how to debug your code. (Please, please, please install Valgrind immediately after starting the course. I promise you\'ll save 2 weeks\' worth of time you\'d otherwise spend debugging weird errors and dealing with memory management in C. You can either launch an EC2 instance or run it through Docker). Modularize your functions, unit test new operators, and spend time thinking about the high\u2013level concepts (you should really only spend 30% of your time on this project actually coding); this project isn\'t bad once you realize how to break a big task into a collection of smaller ones. 3) The grading is very generous with extra credit, namely, on the midterms.

Anatomy consists of Dr. Milberg giving slideshow presentations on various structures/functions of the brain, sometimes using a human brain or a model. It can be easy to get a bit lost in this part of the course, so don\'t be afraid to ask questions. You\'ll also learn the most if you buy the workbook he recommends and actually use it. The anatomy section is tested with a relatively easy midterm. The second segment is group presentations on famous cases of abnormal cognition \u2014 think Phineas Gage, HM, ect. \u2014 that build on some anatomy knowledge but are generally interesting to work on & listen to. The take\u2013home final was based on these cases. Our seminar was also offered an opportunity during reading period to do one last \\"cutting\\" of the brain to access some of the structures we weren\'t able to physically see earlier in the class.\xa0Overall, I\'d highly recommend the course \u2014 it\'s a \'gem\' in it\'s low required workload (again, you get the most if you do work outside of class that\'s not required) BUT it is also extremely interesting. Dr. Milberg is a gem of an instructor. He is incredibly knowledgable, friendly, accessible, and has a lot of interesting personal stories about cases he\'s seen throughout his career. This is a low\u2013stakes way to learn brain anatomy (which is surprisingly lacking in the College\'s neuroscience department) because the workload is very low and Milberg is very willing to entertain questions. Even if anatomy is not the most interesting subject for you (as it wasn\'t for me), examining a real human brain is a unique opportunity that is hard to come by. The cases were also very interesting with a good mix of diversity. I didn\'t think I had retained that much from the anatomy section but I was surprised at how much I actually remembered when we came to the cases.","workload_score_mean":2.2,"best_gem_comment_short":"Overall, I\'d highly recommend the course \u2014 it\'s a \'gem\' in it\'s low required workload (again, you get the most if you do work outside of class that\'s not required) BUT it is also extremely interesting.","course_id":"109866","link":"https://harvard.bluera.com/harvard/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=c4d23fc548fdf238167bfbff217eb28a498111847b393d0ce1a18dd3bf1e614f411a5d90cb5225cb3b8eb1e0341fce99&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"},{"course_code":"GOV 1737","useful_title":"Evaluating the Impacts of Public Policies How to Design and Implement Randomized Controlled Trials","course_score_mean":4.77,"rec_score_mean":4.69,"gem_score_mean":0.1428571429,"sentiment_score_median":0.8481,"best_gem_comment":"Truly a gem!

I developed a bigger appreciation for classical music but also became able to think about more modern music in a completely new light.2. IT\'S NOT MUCH WORK AND NOT STRESSFUL AT ALL: A true gem. INCREDIBLY interesting lectures and course material, great assignments, also a SUPER polished and organized course. And truly, this course is not very difficult or stressful. Still, I was motivated to do well because the teaching staff is so great, which brings me to...3. THE COURSE STAFF: Oh. my. god. I LOVED my TF in this class (Cana McGhee, she\'s a gem), but the other ones were also SICK. Section was such a joy, had amazing convos, great music listening, and always walked out having Shazam\'d at least 2 new songs.4. MICHAEL UY: This man right here, is just, *chef\'s kiss*. Never have I had a professor so eloquent, enthusiastic, personable, funny, polished, relatable, and SO INTELLIGENT at the same time. Every lecture, every moment of this course was made so enjoyable because of Michael. He also knew everyone\'s name (I\'m talking like 120 people) after the second week.

From sharing fun facts about ourselves at the start of class to watching documentaries on cons, I felt like I learned so much about my classmates and the world in general.

This is simply fact. You will find a great community of students and really welcoming teaching faculty who will assist you in every way they can. Some people might describe this class as scarring yourself with knowledge such that you build scar tissue to protect you from the trauma of future classes at Harvard and beyond, but it is important to remember that this metaphorical scar is composed of learning the most wide array of topics possible for an introductory course and that in and of itself is valuable.  It can help narrow down what you are interested in studying or fill in the gaps of a subject you may have felt initially weak in.  Another benefit is that the speed of learning and organization of this class will likely prepare you for rigorous courses that have plentiful resources and study aids down the line since LS50 is much more amorphous in the material it covers. Regardless, you will have to be dedicated to the pursuit of learning and thinking like a researcher over worrying over the granularity of your grades. If you focus on the minutiae of points, this is not the class for you and you will likely feel that the outcome of this class is not worth the work entailed. The perception of difficulty and  challenge within this course is only natural and there are many points throughout the course where no student has a detailed background in what is being taught, creating a more even playing field. Personally, the second semester has been exponentially easier than the first in terms of psets and exams although it\'s not a complete pushover.  Given that LS50 restricts 5 out of the 8 courses you take within your freshman year, I believe the second semester\'s lowered difficulty will allow you to take on an additional 1 or even 2 courses. With all that said, this class is definitely not for everyone. If you are not interested in exploring the integration of mathematical and physics based components into biology or chemistry, immediately walk away and run in the other direction. Ls1B and LS1A are much better fits for people interested in pure bio and chem. If you are somewhere wavering in between and wondering why this inclusion of math in biology is important or even remotely interesting, it allows you to dive deep into the mechanics of cells and life that are often taken for granted in typical life science courses and presents a useful paradigm for research questions and modeling of biological systems. Personally, I entered this course much more interested in medicine than research but in exiting, I have grown to appreciate research more in tandem with medicine. Deciding to take this course is a pretty huge decision and one that should not be left up to your ego. It\'s important to level your expectations by consulting with a previous student or some members of the teaching faculty but even in cases where expectations were not necessarily aligned with the reality of the course, there is a general consensus of feeling extremely rewarded by all this class has to offer.","best_comment_short":"You will find a great community of students and really welcoming teaching faculty who will assist you in every way they can.","best_comment_first":"LS50 WILL BE THE DEFINING PART OF YOUR FRESHMAN YEAR if you decide to take this course.","course_id":"159707","link":"https://harvard.bluera.com/harvard/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=58302da63369f8e5375422e81d286e10a71f2fad57897c155d241efee983695b9cc16eb035ac9907e2ae98acf49cd17d&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"},{"course_code":"HAA 42P","useful_title":"Architecture through the Ages Notre-Dame-de-Paris","course_score_mean":4.6,"rec_score_mean":4.63,"gem_score_mean":0,"sentiment_score_median":0.9106,"best_gem_comment":"","workload_score_mean":4.6,"best_gem_comment_short":"","best_comment":"Fantastic HAA course.

As I age and mature, I find myself a little less pliable, elasticity slowly bowing to rigidity. And yet, this class was a belonging space for me and a resounding one at that. In my PhD program my writing had been everything but handled tenderly. I\u2019m under no delusion that my writing doesn\u2019t need work; however, I\u2019ve never been in a space where we are so strongly encouraged to find the good, the cors and to make a piece the best version of itself not your best version. Academia has largely severed my connection with writing although it was my lifeblood as an introverted child working through what I now recognize as trauma. I\u2019ve gradually lost my connection to the sustaining power of this art, compounding my pain. This class has begun to mend that relationship. It\u2019s forced me to see the good in my own work. It\u2019s pushed me to offer myself the same tenderness that I seek to offer others.Within the first few classes, if not the first class, Meng was able to invite us into a space where not only were we affirmed, but so too was our writing. The writing exercises early on both excited and intimidated me. Watching the ink spread on my page gave form and life to my ideas. So many of them have gone untilled, unattended that it seemed impossible to ever watch them flower and fruit. Within the greenhouse of our classroom, as I released my cors into the atmosphere and so did my peers, our gifts collided, thickened, and nourished us all. I\u2019ve learned so much from this class. Let the erotic lead you to the \u201cI.\u201d Continually asking myself, \u201cwhat comes through the hole?,\u201d diverging from tropes and detouring from the paths our minds try to take us for a more excellent way, and, of course, \u201ctell, don\u2019t show.\u201d But even beyond these, the hardest lesson Meng has taught is the importance (and challenge) of writing the good. the beautiful. the delightful. I must admit, this is a lesson that I will be learning for the rest of my life, but it\u2019s one of which I\u2019m beginning to appreciate the value. I really needed this class. It has done more for me than I can adequately express.

This isn\'t really the worst thing \u2013 the textbook is wonderful in my opinion \u2013 but it makes the value proposition of a 9am lecture not great. Similarly for sections. That being said, I went to CA office hours regularly (shoutout to David and Christine) and found a ton of support and camaraderie in the class.The psets are a good mix too. I personally like the probability side of the class (i.e. Poisson processes, Brownian motion, Ito calculus) far more than the computational side (Markov chains, Metropolis\u2013Hastings, etc.), so I enjoyed the latter half of the class exponentially more than the front half. The first couple psets are quite bashy, and the fourth pset on MCMC is literally all in R (you should be ready to learn R, because you\'ll be using it liberally), but the rest are generally fine, and often quite elegant.Finally, the exams are hard, and they\'re a big chunk of your grade. If I had known how hard, I would have seriously considered not taking the class \u2013 unlike the psets, which are almost entirely textbook questions, the exams are hard because you have to apply course concepts in ways that were really never explained or described in lecture/section. If you\'re not used to that (for ref., lots of people in the course took stat 210 before this or are upperclassmen stats concentrators), the exams will be hard \u2013 I\'m a potential math concentrator who took three other math/stat classes, and they definitely were my hardest exams.

First of all, Prof. Auroux is wonderful. He\'s incredibly accessible and cares about making sure people are doing well. He is going to be in France next year, but I\'m sure whoever is teaching 55 in 2022\u20132023 will be great! The material is really beautiful (although you can certainly have more of a taste for certain things than others), and it feels ever\u2013so\u2013slightly more chill than 55A.The material is honestly quite interesting. Topology \u2013 and especially algebraic topology\xa0\u2013 is a fundamental discipline to basically anything, and Auroux\'s presentation of complex analysis is very good for getting you to appreciate just how beautiful of a subject it is. Full disclosure, I am not the biggest analysis fan \u2013 I liked alg top far more \u2013 and I didn\'t have any experience with real analysis. Yet, often during the two weeks we talked about real analysis, there was a general sentiment of \\"yeah this is all stuff we should know.\\" The point being: this class is technically an introduction to all these fields, but unless you\'re ready and willing to make it the center of your spring semester, it won\'t be a very comfortable introduction.The psets were also generally fun. There were some questions that definitely should have been marked as challenge problems that were simply not, but beyond that they were good. Do start psets early, or at least look at them early \u2013 it takes time for things to sit and be mulled over in your head! The exams can be a big source of stress, but I think they were generally easier than in 55A \u2013 analysis at this level is often \\"done on autopilot,\\" in that there\'s only so many tricks you can try before something ends up working. Overall, try to stay on top of the material \u2013 it is much harder than you expect to catch up if you fall behind, speaking from experience.On the other hand, the class environment in 55B is... less than stellar. Your best hope is to find a good group of people to pset with that aren\'t magnets for drama, but in my case, there was so much drama going on that I didn\'t go to lecture for a very long time. 55 attracts a very specific kind of person \u2013 generally, people who enjoy suffering, or enjoy watching other suffer around them, and people who, as mathematicians, haven\'t quite mellowed out from the cutthroat, competitive, and prestige\u2013centric attitude that high school math things breed. If I could have taken the class entirely remotely, I probably would have.So, should you take 55B? First, I don\'t think 55A is a strict prerequisite, but definitely a soft one \u2013 the familiarity with group theory is essential for alg top. And as my experience goes, I think there\'s basically no barrier to entry, save for how much time you\'re ready to put into it. If you want math to be the center of your spring semester, then go for it. If not, then take 25B or 22B, or whatever is best for you (you\'ll quickly realize that if prestige is what you\'re shooting for, your mental and physical wellbeing are high costs to pay for it). In any case, good luck with your decision and whatever you choose to do!","best_comment_short":"The material is really beautiful (although you can certainly have more of a taste for certain things than others), and it feels ever\u2013so\u2013slightly more chill than 55A.The material is honestly quite interesting.","best_comment_first":"Math 55B was a very interesting course.","course_id":"112871","link":"https://harvard.bluera.com/harvard/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=1af56bc14b1ced2eb0a233db1f648addea9bbe054e39d544db23c3b375ace0acf27ef9d46b1d84a94f9180f2dd3e0854&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"},{"course_code":"EXPOS 40","useful_title":"Public Speaking Practicum","course_score_mean":4.7,"rec_score_mean":4.8,"gem_score_mean":0,"sentiment_score_median":0.9244,"best_gem_comment":"","workload_score_mean":3.8,"best_gem_comment_short":"","best_comment":"Your experience is very dependent on who your section leader is.

The material is so insanely well taught. Wes\'s strength is in analysis so he motivates examples and provides intuition really well. The lectures are very good, and he answers all questions during the lectures. However, this results in the fact that most classes end around five minutes over time, and additional videos may be posted if the material isn\'t completely covered. Also, this class was a 9AM three times a week (with no recordings), so just make sure you\'re prepared for this. The community is really great, and many students in this class actually did not come from a high school math background but were more so interested in fields that require knowledge of real analysis. Because of this, a collaborative environment was fostered. I think it\'s really important to find people to pset with, if not the most important. Definitely definitely attend Wes\'s office hours. He is an amazing professor but also such a kind person, and it\'s very nice to get to know him! He can also clarify gaps in your knowledge about lecture material. For psets, I think it\'s more helpful to go to the CAs office hours since you can collaborate with students, but Wes gives great intuition behind how to solve the problems. This class is extremely rewarding, in my opinion, if you put in the time. Because the psets are not graded harshly, it felt that a lot of my energy was spent truly learning the material instead of perfecting pset solutions like in some other classes. Overall, this class is tough but rewarding.

This class is accessible to a fairly wide range of math backgrounds, has a good balance of definitions and interesting results (i.e. not too many of the former and plenty of the latter), and the problem solving on the PSets and exams is mostly satisfying. I\'ll now get into more detail about what I felt were this class\' pros and cons.Pros:\u2013 Lectures. Dr. Balibanu does an amazing job explaining difficult concepts so that everyone can understand them. Coming from a limited math background (only previous math courses were 21a/b, with some proof\u2013writing experience), I was somewhat apprehensive about my level of preparation for the class. The most out of place I ever felt was occasionally when she would ask, \\"who here has at least heard of concept X,\\" to which most of the class excluding me raised their hands. However, she would go on to then clearly explain the concept and how it related to the material at hand. Despite my minimal prior math experience, I found the lectures very clear and easy to follow. This was especially evident when trying to self\u2013teach myself the concepts from textbooks \u2013\u2013 the lectures were significantly easier to learn from.\u2013 Course content. Obviously this is very subjective, but complex analysis lies at the intersection of many areas of math wherein many interesting results are fairly easily accessible, without needing to get bogged down in too many definitions. The class is at face value an extension of multivariable calculus to the complex numbers, and it provides very nice ways to think about otherwise difficult problems such as the fundamental theorem of algebra, certain real\u2013valued integrals and infinite sums, and the Riemann zeta function. It is clear that the concepts of complex analysis are very useful for future areas in math, but even if you\'re not planning on continuing to study math, they are also pretty fun to learn/think about in and of themselves.\u2013 Course staff. As previously mentioned, Dr. Balibanu is a great lecturer. She is also generally very accessible in office hours and in Slack, and the TFs are similarly helpful, especially in the resources and review sessions they have before tests.\u2013 Grading. The grading for this course is half PSets and half exams. The PSets can be tricky and occasionally take a while, but office hours are great in helping to get through them, and they are graded leniently. The exams are very fair \u2013\u2013 the problems are often easier versions of those from the PSets, and lots of points are given just for remembering definitions (btw \u2013\u2013 when studying, make sure to know all the results, especially those with names).Cons:\u2013 Course materials. Outside of lecture, the only real supplementary course resource is the textbook which, as I previously mentioned, can be difficult to learn from. This is fine if you go to all the lectures and take good notes, but there are no lecture notes/recordings to help catch you up to speed if you don\'t (though this was Dr. Balibanu\'s first iteration of the course, so maybe this will change).\u2013 Feedback. The only feedback given is the PSet and exam grades. The exams were graded pretty quickly, which was appreciated. However, the PSets often took many weeks to be returned, which especially mattered given that there were (generally) no PSet solutions available other than by going to TFs during office hours and asking for explanations.\u2013 Computational homework problems. The PSets were a mix of conceptual and computational problems. While the conceptual problems were generally good concept review, the computational problems sometimes became tedious and felt like busywork.","best_comment_short":"It is clear that the concepts of complex analysis are very useful for future areas in math, but even if you\'re not planning on continuing to study math, they are also pretty fun to learn/think about in and of themselves.\u2013 Course staff.","best_comment_first":"Overall, this is a great class \u2013\u2013 if you are at all interested in theoretical math and especially if it is still being taught by Dr. Balibanu, definitely take it.","course_id":"113608","link":"https://harvard.bluera.com/harvard/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=e3fcf59b25cb7523a5778751dbb08c92a4fe7bc67e90061e898cdf99b8caa9c0fc4b5878ad11c978f0e74e92a0ef82db&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"},{"course_code":"HISTSCI 99B","useful_title":"Tutorial - Senior Year","course_score_mean":4.39,"rec_score_mean":4.55,"gem_score_mean":0,"sentiment_score_median":0.7835,"best_gem_comment":"","workload_score_mean":14.89,"best_gem_comment_short":"","best_comment":"Writing a thesis was super rewarding and I highly recommend it!!!

While I really liked the teaching staff, it did feel pretty chaotic and disorganized most of the time. This class was the most \\"english\\" class I have taken so far \u2014 nearly every other sentence was a reference to a canonical piece that I had not read so I often felt pretty out of my wheelhouse.

So often class was just talking about random (although interesting) things that weren\'t always super central to the text. The assignments were pretty flexible though \u2014 up to two creative assignments out of four total.

Taking Ross\' Personhood in U.S. Constitutional Law expos was one of the best decisions I made my first\u2013year and I say this with full confidence. Ross is the best and he makes this course what it is. He\'s simply just an incredible educator. I feel like I had really outstanding teachers in high school,  so it was so amazing getting to connect with a college instructor who I felt cared for me like my high school teachers did. He is genuinely invested in seeing you grow and thrive as a student and this is something that you will come to see and appreciate more clearly as the semester progresses. He will constantly check\u2013in with you and he\'s always happy to chat with you (one of the highlights of my semester was talking with Ross after our expos section ended). Besides the fact that Ross is just an incredible human and terrific preceptor, the course content is super interesting. A variety of really important Supreme Court cases make up the core of the reading for this class which is really cool. The discussions you\'ll have in class are nuanced, engaging, and really meaningful. You\'ll feel closer to all the people in your section because you collectively take on talking about very difficult topics. This is certainly a class that pushes you, but I think that was one of my favorite parts of the course. The rigor never feels arbitrary or unnecessary; it feels deliberate and productive. Ross has spent a lot of time fine\u2013tuning this course and that comes across when you\'re a student in the course who can see how well\u2013run it is.

Finally, if you are a student with strong religious convictions, I will say that this class takes a materialistic approach to religion, and so there are some interpretations/portrayals that you will not agree with because of a difference in first principles.

Essentially, TL;DR if Wes is teaching this class, take it basically no matter what. If he\'s not, still take the class, but many of these comments might not apply.General (not teaching staff related):Personal academic experience: I came in with 25a and a pretty reasonable analysis background from high school. While this made the class significantly easier, and I definitely spent less time on it than 25a, it was still a difficult course, especially at the very beginning and very end of the semester. I still thus recommend taking 25b, even if you have previous analysis experience. For me specifically, when I took analysis in high school I didn\'t have a great linear algebra background, and I lost a lot of the intuition and appreciation for the material that I was able to gain in 25b. The course is an incredible deep\u2013dive into real analysis, and you come out of it with a very good understanding of the fundamentals. Notably, if you\'re thinking of taking 55b, that course doesn\'t cover real analysis in nearly as much depth\u2013\u2013from what I heard, they spent a week on it. Additionally, at least with Wes, he made sure that we got computational practice and worked with applications quite a bit, so for a non\u2013pure math concentrator I feel like this class might be more useful than 55b.The intensive nature of this class and the small size made the community very strong. While I feel like it was accentuated with our specific teaching staff, I think that this is probably a constant for 25. For 90% of the class, it was basically impossible to complete the problem sets without at least some (and often a lot of) collaboration. You often found at least 12\u201315 people of the 20 person class at Tuesday night office hours. These office hours are some of my favorite memories of my freshman year, not just because of Saint Knut, the CA for those office hours, but also due to the fervent communal energy that would often last late into Wednesday morning. It was a truly collaborative atmosphere\u2013\u2013everyone contributed, and everyone benefited. All of these qualities made the class feel more like a seminar\u2013style class than a classic lecture\u2013based one in terms of the tight\u2013knit community that formed. Adding to the fact that most of us had taken 25a and had known each other since the beginning of freshman year, I can\'t think of a better class in terms of community. I\'m serious: especially for STEM majors, you\'re not gonna get better than this.Wes:A gem among gems. Potentially the best teacher I\'ve ever had, and definitely the best math lecturer. I assume this applies to any class he teaches, so this almost certainly applies if you\'re considering taking 19a, 118r, or some other class that he\'s teaching. His lectures are sometimes transcendental experiences, Picard\u2013Lindelof proof in particular. (I\'m not joking\u2013\u2013I was literally dreaming about how beautiful the proof was the night after the lecture.) His enthusiasm for the material, particularly 25b material, is obvious and so infectious. He made the class feel like a journey\u2013\u2013with the Picard\u2013Lindelof proof, for example, he hyped up that proof specifically for weeks before we got to it, and when he finally proved it in class, the way so many of the concepts we had been learning about fit together so perfectly in the proof was just beautiful. He forces us to participate in lectures, and in a very constructive way that, combined with the clarity and deliberateness of his lecturing, made if feel like I could have proved the given proposition or theorem myself if I was given enough time. He also clearly and genuinely cares about his students, hosting numerous office hours and making himself available to schedule individual appointments whenever. His (sometimes intentional, sometimes not) humor also added to the lecture experience. Yes, it\'s a 9am three days a week, but it was so worth it. Wes does have a few annoying principles that he sticks to very stubbornly: the worst of these is absolutely no flexibility in deadlines (like if you submit something five minutes late you might get a zero). The exams are also in person and quite difficult, although if you study from the problem sets and lecture notes they\'re usually doable. All in all, the 25 sequence, including 25b, was one of my favorite and most memorable experiences from freshman year. Both 25a and 25b were my favorite classes each semester, due in part to the interesting material, but much more due to the fantastic people in the class, the community and the wonderful teaching we were privileged to experience. I got a little emotional at the end of the final lecture.

If you took Math 55a you are most definitely prepared to take on this class. We also had I think about 4 students from Math 25a and 2 students from Math 22.Based on my experience and other friends\u2019 feedback it feels that Math 55b was a decent bit easier than Math 55a and that in some sense last semester was the \u201creal Math 55 experience.\u201d Last semester we were forced to work together on hard problems for a long time and go to office hours for help, and as a result, we formed a close community and had a deeper understanding of the materials. To some extent this semester we had the continuation of that community but personally, I felt like I understood last semester\u2019s material better and had more interactions with the CAs and just everyone in the class.This course is titled \\"Studies in Real and Complex Analysis,\\" but on the first day of class, the professor explains to you that in reality, it is more like Math 131+Math113. We roughly had three units: 3.5 weeks on point set topology, 3.5 weeks on algebraic topology, and 5 weeks on complex analysis. As a result, we don\u2019t really dive into real analysis and students should learn this important area of mathematics on their own at some point.We followed Munkres\u2019 Topology through the first two units. In point set topology we learned about fundamental concepts such as product and quotient topology, connectedness, compactness, and separation axioms, which is Munkres chapter 12\u201334. So I would recommend future students who want to do some preparation during winter break to read this portion of Munkres. This part of the course was comparably more intuitive and chill (admittedly compactness is not very intuitive).In algebraic topology, we learned about homotopy equivalences, fundamental groups, Seifert\u2013Van Kampen, covering spaces, and briefly introduced topics like higher homotopy groups and homology. This is roughly Munkres chapters 51\u201357 and 79\u201381. This part of the course was quite difficult for me as it is harder to visualize and see the significance of these constructions. Later on, after learning complex analysis, I was finally able to see some of the motivations and applications of these concepts. Definitely try to go to office hours here, for me at least the problem sets involve a degree of hand waving and many drawings.About a week after spring break we started Complex Analysis, which according to Professor Harris is his favorite and most beautiful part of the course (as usual Joe is an absolutely fantastic and supportive lecturer). Here we followed Ahlfors\u2019 Complex Analysis, which honestly is quite terse and hard to understand (reading lecture notes beforehand helps). We started with holomorphic functions and with the introduction of the Cauchy Integral Formula we were equipped to take on harder problems. After learning about poles, singularities, and Laurent series, we did a good amount of Residue calculus which gave us important results about holomorphic and meromorphic functions.I have to admit, I personally did not find complex analysis to be particularly enlightening as it felt like learning a ton of cool formulas and then just applying them to solve some seemingly arbitrary problems. In retrospect, I actually liked the topology portion of the course better as they introduced new ideas I have never considered before. I will likely take Math 231, a course Professor Harris highly recommended.From my perspective my classmates took the following courses alongside 55b: quite a few took CS 124, a decent amount took Stat 111, some took Math 123 or 129 or 132, and a few took CS 181.Throughout this semester I have been thinking hard on what the point of taking Math 55 is. If a student took courses that taught the materials in 55 separately they may get a deeper understanding by virtue of spending more time on them. I have come to a few humble conclusions: I think by compressing a large amount of abstract mathematics into each semester we do get a slightly more surface\u2013level understanding of individual topics. However, at the same time, we got to see some connections between different areas of mathematics that would be otherwise hard to see, for example, algebra with topology, complex analysis with algebraic topology, abstract algebra with linear algebra; and I\u2019m sure some of the smaller topics we did like the exposure to basic category theory will serve us well in the future. I think I got a very solid overall \u201cfeel\u201d and overview of higher\u2013level mathematics. Moreover, 55 is really at its core about the community. I have met some of my closest friends and some of the most interesting people through this class. The late nights at Math Lounge and Math Library will forever be a sweet piece of memory lying in the foundation of my Harvard journey and I\u2019m sure years later my classmates and I will look back fondly on those days and laugh and shed some tears. I highly recommend anyone reading this to reach out to your classmates, schedule a lunch or a walk together and get to know them better. You will not regret this.Overall I think continuing with 55b was the right choice for me and most of my classmates from 55a. If you are considering this course, sit in on a few lectures and check it out! I wish you the best of luck!","best_comment_short":"Definitely try to go to office hours here, for me at least the problem sets involve a degree of hand waving and many drawings.About a week after spring break we started Complex Analysis, which according to Professor Harris is his favorite and most beautiful part of the course (as usual Joe is an absolutely fantastic and supportive lecturer).","best_comment_first":"Math 55b was an interesting experience.","course_id":"112871","link":"https://harvard.bluera.com/harvard/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=457a1684046c241eeaea84daea2cda48fc6f8155cee39c09d3a1de631139e2ca82163a83f36ba95bfb0ce68856c85143&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"},{"course_code":"KOREAN 123XB","useful_title":"Intermediate Korean for Advanced Beginners","course_score_mean":4.82,"rec_score_mean":4.55,"gem_score_mean":0,"sentiment_score_median":0.8426,"best_gem_comment":"","workload_score_mean":6.64,"best_gem_comment_short":"","best_comment":"This is not an easy class, but it is incredibly rewarding and definitely worth taking.

That said, I would recommend it with reservations. Here is everything you need to know:First, what should you take, Chem 17 or Chem 20? Chem 20 is definitely a harder course based on looking at the Chem 17 problem sets and exams and talking to many people taking Chem 17. One main difference between the courses is that Chem 20 teaches organic synthesis, which is a pretty challenging skill. For context, most people I know didn\u2019t get a single synthesis problem on the exams fully right until the way end of the semester. That said, once you get the hang of synthesis, it is much more enjoyable than arrow\u2013pushing mechanisms, which is the focus of Chem 17/27. Another major difference is that Chem 20 has lab while Chem 17 does not. The lab was probably my least favorite part of Chem 20 just because it is so long (4 hours at night) and very tedious, but you have to do lab in Chem 27 anyway, so lab should not be a reason to avoid Chem 20. A third major difference is that the problem sets in Chem 17 are pass/fail, while the problem sets in Chem 20 are not. That said, there are so many bonus points on problem sets in Chem 20 that you can easily get 100% if you put in the work. Most people I know got 100% in the problem set portion of the grade, so don\u2019t worry about this portion of the course. A fourth major difference is the vibe of the course. The TFs, PSLs, and lead instructor of Chem 20 are way more supportive than in Chem 17 based on what I have heard. Everyone wants you to succeed and will help you as much as you want, which makes a challenging subject like Organic Chemistry much more enjoyable. Fifth, the exams in Chem 20 are apparently much more fair than in Chem 17. Don\u2019t get me wrong, you have to spend a LOT of time studying, but putting in the work will pay off, which is really rewarding. I have not heard the same thing about the Chem 17 exams, which are apparently are intended to trick you. Finally, the grading curve in Chem 20 is slightly better than Chem 17, but both grading curves are not particularly generous. A big difference, though, is that in Chem 20 the grading curve is fixed at the start of the semester, while the Chem 17 grading curve changes depending on how students are doing. As a result, Chem 17 is much more competitive because you are competing against your classmates. Just for reference, in spring 2023, you needed a 90 to get in A in Chem 20 and an 85 to get an A\u2013.To succeed in Chem 20, here is my advice. First, stay on top of the content as it is taught. This class moves really fast and it is cumulative, so do the purple book practice problems for each week\u2019s module. YOU WON\u2019T HAVE TIME TO LEARN ALL OF THE REQUIRED MATERIAL THE WEEK BEFORE THE TEST. Each exam is cumulative, so make sure you stay on top of the previous units as well. Second, go to office hours/helproom to work on the problem set. While there, really focus not just on the answers but on learning the material. The main factor that determines your grade in chem 20 is the exams, so treat the problem sets as a learning experience, not as required assignments that matter a lot on their own. The TFs are fantastic, so don\u2019t be afraid to ask them questions. Third, start studying for the exams a least a week in advance. Often, you will not realize just how much material has been covered until you sit down and start working through practice problems. The exams are pretty challenging, but for the most part are fair. Make sure to study the stuff you think you are not as good at, even if you don\u2019t think it\'s gonna show up on the test (because it probably will). Fourth, GO TO ALL OF THE LECTURES! Unlike LS1a and other intro classes, the lectures are not required/there are no poll questions to assess participation. But, that\'s because the instructors know they don\u2019t need to require people to come since the lectures are useful on their own. If you don\u2019t come to lecture, you will be in big trouble for the exams. Fifth, don\u2019t feel obligated to go to section every week since they are optional. Also, if other TFs are better, just go to their section instead of your own. Use section to help YOU; I often didn\u2019t go and still got an A in the class. Finally, Orgo lab is not fun, but it won\u2019t matter much for your grade, so just try your best and it will be fine, even if it doesn\u2019t feel that way when going through the class.

The kids who had experience interning in finance and investment banking were at a significant advantage. Same with the kids who had taken some other sort of financial economics class. I also think that you would significantly benefit from the class if you were considering an Econ PhD down the road. The class definitely expects that you know a decent amount beforehand, like acronyms of random financial concepts, but you could always look these up or just ask the professor what they are. The class also has no textbook, so if you don\'t really understand lecture but want to grind the material at home, you\'ll really only have the lecture slides, which are kind of confusing when not paired with the lecture (and office hours, of course).That being said, if you\'re somewhat of an outsider to the field, you can still do well \u2013\u2013 just expect an uphill battle and the frequent feeling that everyone somehow knows more than you.

Even if you don\'t understand everything he says at first, the mere fact that you\'re hearing  from someone who served on the Fed Board of Governors has a great impact on your thinking in the long run. You\'ll get great insight into the decisions that policymakers and bankers face, and you\'ll get great exposure to contrasting economic ideas. Rather than just learning how to compute rote financial metrics,  you\'ll learn how to critically think about financial concepts and dynamics. I think that the type of thinking Stein teaches is not only valuable for those aiming to be leaders in the world of finance, but for anyone seeking to use analytical skills in decision\u2013making roles.","best_comment_short":"He\'s a very kind and brilliant professor \u2013\u2013 he memorized all of our first names \u2013\u2013 and this course is one of a kind at Harvard.","best_comment_first":"Can be very helpful to be comfortable with econometrics, otherwise you won\'t really understand the papers that you are expected to read and critique.","course_id":"156356","link":"https://harvard.bluera.com/harvard/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=b4db2c9a93e22b92bf4fe1ea3f6fca2115c9c8827cffadadfdfc9919df4132103991b7088877786297a5086a3f50e7e7&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"},{"course_code":"HIST 15F","useful_title":"Political Violence in the Twentieth Century","course_score_mean":4.4,"rec_score_mean":4.2,"gem_score_mean":0,"sentiment_score_median":0.8765,"best_gem_comment":"","workload_score_mean":6.2,"best_gem_comment_short":"","best_comment":"This class was really interesting and if you are interested in the subject of violence and how it manifests, I would recommend this class.

Don\'t be mistaken, this course is definitely an incredible amount of work and normally we were doing about ~80 pages of reading a week, sometimes more, sometimes less but I\'d say on average it was about that much. However, with that said, coming into this class, I was not much of a reader but coming out of it, I\'ve genuinely improved my ability to quickly skim and pull out the most important parts from readings (which is a super great skill in my opinion to have). Professor Felter cares so incredibly much about ensuring that you succeed \u2013\u2013 he leaves a large breadth of comments on your assignments that makes it very very clear on how you can improve for your next one. I\'ve never had a professor be so thoughtful and engaging in our comments. He is extremely accessible outside of class, scheduling office hours 1\u2013on\u20131 with you around your schedule and it was wonderful getting to know him. He is a super cool guy overall \u2013\u2013 a lot of amazing stories from when he was a lawyer and through law school. Overall, I think this course is a pretty good introduction to what *might* be expected in a law school class and I think it genuinely helped convince me that I for sure want to go to law school because I was on the fence when I had taken this class about it. Additionally, even though professor Felter cold calls at times, what I appreciated was he never made you feel dumb or stupid or isolated if you didn\'t know the answer. He genuinely just wants to lead a nice and productive conversation during class and it\'s a much more enjoyable experience when everyone in the section has done the readings and is able to engage. I\'d for sure be ready to put a good ~10 hours into the course each week, at minimum, if you want to get a good grade and really engage with the content. Normally the readings took me around ~4 hours/week (probably a little more towards the beginning of the semester) to really dig into them and understand them (especially when we had to do our assignments based on the readings) and another good ~6\u20138 hours each week working on the assignments which again, professor Felter spends an incredible amount of time and care with grading them so I\'d for sure spend a good amount of time and care in writing them.

For starters, Professor Ullman\'s insightful lectures and quirky humor made attending class a lot less painful, and I really enjoyed his frequent in\u2013course activities. I got to win one of the dragons he gave out, as well as a toy robot from one of our class \\"intermission\\" exercises, both of which I still have and display on my desk. I was always interested in learning how people think, work, and decide, and this course was right up my alley! I\'m glad to now have precise terms to describe concepts that I understood intuitively, but could just never name. One of the greatest things in the course that I personally enjoyed was the integration of personal reflection, particularly in the Final Thing.

There is literally no homework at all, except a short response at the end of the week where you briefly talk about your time in class that week. However, if you actually want to learn improv, this maybe isn\'t the best class. Class was pretty inconsistent with how you\'d receive feedback during scene work, which was unfair. For example, asking questions during an improv scene is frowned upon. When guys in our class asked questions during scene work, even if it was necessary for the flow of the scene, they were castigated for doing so immediately, and experienced frequent interruptions in their scene work from Remo. However, when certain girls in our class would make the exact same mistakes, they were not critiqued or interrupted as frequently in their scene work. Why was this the case? Not sure. As a girl, I noticed these differences.It doesn\'t feel like you really learn anything about improv in this class. You simply play games and exercises for 2 hours, and in the lucky chance that you get to do a scene, you get interrupted constantly by Remo, which makes it extremely difficult to actually learn how to improve. Certain people have certain strengths when it comes to acting, and it didn\'t feel like we catered to those strengths as much as we could have. There\'s the famous Einstein quote about how judging a fish by its ability to climb a tree is an inaccurate way to gauge the fish\'s abilities, and this metaphor could not be applied more to this class. For example, judging one\'s comfort and ability to dance to Taylor Swift songs in front of everyone is not an accurate way to see how comfortable someone is dancing and how good they are at dancing. Why not switch up the music playlist, and see the differences of how people dance? In this regard The class heavily catered to women like myself, and felt inconsistent with how normal classes at Harvard operate.","workload_score_mean":1.55,"best_gem_comment_short":"This is a great class if you\'re looking for an easy 4th GEM.","course_id":"160654","link":"https://harvard.bluera.com/harvard/rpvf-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=d9dd738f6680cb10c51936db34a2a0b7ceb95fbbddd8132322bb5003293ef2ab2bf685313c8532302d9ddbb1ef46408e&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"},{"course_code":"ENG-SCI 152","useful_title":"Circuits, Devices, and Transduction","course_score_mean":4.77,"rec_score_mean":4.54,"gem_probability_mean":0.0909090909,"sentiment_score_median":0.8964,"best_gem_comment":"To begin with, to all the EE concentrators, you have probably heard of this course and/or the iconic Gage Hills, and I assure you the hype is real. Of all the courses in EE I have taken, none has been as effective as ES152 in instilling an intrinsic curiosity and desire to truly understand how things work. This course is very challenging. Be aware that this class is called ES152: Circuits, Devices, and Transduction, which Gage will point out should probably be three separate courses. That means that material which should be covered in three semesters (or more) will be covered in one. It\'s a big ask, and Gage being as dedicated and passionate about the material as he is, will not skimp or shy away from unturning as many stones as possible in this one semester. Don\'t be afraid though. It is one hell of a ride. The lectures are always focused on establishing intuition and Gage has an incredible ability and level of patience to explain concepts in a step\u2013by\u2013step way, building on your understanding and connecting sub\u2013concepts into full topics.  The lectures are so entertaining and useful that this is a class where you would never want to miss a lecture. They are very engaging (pun intended) and Gage even spends hours outside of class making MATLAB simulations of MOSFETS and electron orbitals just to help us have a better visual. Homework was split into analyticals and labs. They come as a set, intended to be given once a week/two weeks. Fair warning, each homework is very long, ranging from 20\u201330hrs on average. However, the homework is full of excellent explanations and guidance, and although you may go pale seeing subparts a\u2013t for a single question, know that by the end of it, you will be amazed by how deeply you understand the concept that question was targeting. Labs were excellent. They covered a good variety of material like audio amplifiers, DACs, and semiconductor devices. Georgios, who I hope will still be a TF for the course, did an incredible job redesigning these labs last year with Gage. Georgios is a gem for the course and has some of the best advice, understanding, and explanations for course material. If he\'s available in lab or outside of class, he is a wonderful asset to the course and is a great person to discuss questions and concepts with. Speaking of teaching staff, the TFs were truly a dream team. I have never witnessed a course where all the TFs were as all\u2013around excellent as in ES152. Georgios, TomHenry, and Jalil were the Holy Trinity. TomHenry was a wizard at section. I was amazed at how succinct and intuitively he could explain concepts. Interesting to note is that TomHenry has a more traditional background in how he understands the material, meaning his equations match the textbooks. This was a nice juxtaposition to the less traditional way Gage explained material in lecture. Both approaches have their benefits so getting to hear different angles, one in lecture and one in section, really was a powerful combo. Jalil did a great job leading lab and helping us with debugging any issues. Overall, all the TFs were incredibly enthusiastic, capable, and generous with offering time to help us whenever needed.Lastly, as you have probably come to realize in this long response, Gage is an extraordinary professor. I doubt you could find a student who would describe Gage as anything less than exceptional. No matter if it was the beginning of the course, the weekend, some weekday at 3am, in class, after class, whenever and wherever, Gage is always full of energy and passion for teaching. His dedication toward his students is unparalleled, allowing us to slack him any time we had questions (he responds fast) even late at night, and making it easy to schedule one\u2013on\u2013one time with him if we needed help or just wanted to discuss something. The lectures, homework, and even the final exam were custom catered toward the class. I think Gage takes pride in making the homework questions unique yet comprehensive. For example. the final exam took us step by step in creating a display monitor which was so cool, and it was an amazing moment having Gage guide us in proving to ourselves that with the knowledge gained in this course, we could do things that seemed impossible at our level, like designing circuits to make our computer or phone screens. Gage is an excellent teacher but his dedication to getting to know the class and helping us with problems big or small and doing it with such joy made him the best professor I\'ve ever had. Sometimes, we forget that like any professor, he\'s probably juggling research, meetings, conferences, and his personal life alongside this class, but it was undeniable how much he prioritized this class and every student in the class. This wasn\'t something he had to do, but he does it because of the person he is and because he understands that teaching and learning is not just about giving lectures and doing the bare minimum. Every student learns at a different pace and in a different way, and Gage made sure we never felt short of having the right support and help however and whenever we needed it. ES152 will be challenging but so fulfilling. Be excited. This class will probably convince you of why you love EE. And finally, just know that you\'re in excellent hands.","workload_score_mean":15.92,"best_gem_comment_short":"Georgios is a gem for the course and has some of the best advice, understanding, and explanations for course material.","course_id":"207597","link":"https://harvard.bluera.com/harvard/rpvf-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=06ee09a5b592b7764707ebd5c9b172260d978c8ac0cdf12fefad9da95eb260d57c8eec9bd2372916015bf27067fc9ab5&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"},{"course_code":"PSY 1813","useful_title":"Technology and Mental Health","course_score_mean":4.74,"rec_score_mean":4.68,"gem_probability_mean":0.0769230769,"sentiment_score_median":0.9483,"best_gem_comment":"Shifali is a true gem.

However, I never felt overwhelmed in the class and the material was so interesting that I didn\'t mind spending a long time on the assignments. I enjoyed learning about imperialism in its historical context, as well as looking at modern\u2013day iterations of imperialism, such as international aid and adoption. I also appreciated that Hannah gave us multiple options for the public engagement project and the final paper.

This has been my favorite class during my first semester. The assignments are fun and are flexible to your interests even though we have specific reading materials to focus on.  The readings in this course were extremely interesting. Each reading assignment was a different court case that we then discussed in class and the discussions were incredibly rich. This class will challenge you and the assignments will take work and effort but the entire process is incredibly rewarding. The comments Ross gives are fantastic. I\'ve used them to guide each of my drafts and final essays. The feedback served as a sounding board for how I was doing, and I internalized those comments. I mentioned at the start of the year that I wanted to know when my essay was quality without the use of a rubric or someone else, and through the comments I\'ve been able to point out issues with my paper on my own now at the end of the semester.The most rewarding to me was our discussion section. The in\u2013class experience was my favorite part of the class. The classroom environment that Ross, my peers, and I created over the semester has been one of my favorite aspects of the Harvard experience so far. I appreciate how supportive and respectful the discussions are and, the student\u2013led aspect of our discussions has led to many personal revelations, closer relationships, and overall understandings across multiple perspectives. On the instructor level, Dr. Ross Martin is genuinely one of the best instructors I\'ve ever had. He is very intentional in what he says and the way he runs his classroom. You can tell that in every action and sentence, he wants the best for his students and the people he interacts with. I needed that in my first semester here. The amount of care and kindness that he has shown to me and the rest of my peers is unmatched. I am so grateful to have been a part of this class and been his student.In terms of preparation, I think it is good to have experience in writing research papers in high school.

For example, when learning some adjectives, good adjectives will be associated with western parenting and bad adjectives associated with asian or chinese parenting, which is quite ridiculous and which uses lots of stereotypes. I personally do not care what a textbook writer thinks of my parents or their parenting (or my future parenting for that matter) but I think some people might find it quite offensive and I think it is just inappropriate in general to treat Chinese culture or Chinese parents in such an unfair and biased way. The textbook also gives the vibe of trying to criticize Chinese culture or the Chinese government whenever there is a chance, which I guess is not surprising because it\'s America but even as someone who is not the biggest fan of the Chinese government and fully aware of its problems, I still think it is a bit excessive and unnecessary since it is a Chinese class after all, and I find it hard to imagine an English class textbook with criticisms of British/American culture or the American government whenever possible.","best_comment_short":"Yu and Xiong Laoshi also really cares about the students, and we have fun lots of fun activities like playing games or watching popular/funny videos in class.","best_comment_first":"As someone who mainly self\u2013studied Chinese before taking this course as my first Chinese class, I would say it is very accessible, the teachers Yu Laoshi and Xiong Laoshi are very nice, and I certainly improved a lot on speaking and listening (which was what I was aiming for since I self\u2013studied mainly through reading, but there are also improvements in writing/reading for sure).","course_id":"207494","link":"https://harvard.bluera.com/harvard/rpvf-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=0bc897917abc5f3a4967f425560b4bc304e0af7e532a0625cabd82e714f5f94ad1d8b039a3e5038184c759250fcd117a&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"},{"course_code":"EXPOS 10","useful_title":"Introduction to Expository Writing","course_score_mean":4.83,"rec_score_mean":4.67,"gem_probability_mean":0,"sentiment_score_median":0.4404,"best_gem_comment":"","workload_score_mean":4.83,"best_gem_comment_short":"","best_comment":"I\'m really glad I took this class.

Please take it if you have any interest in race, racism, or the intersection of science and racism. Professor Fuente was an absolutely incredible teacher. From day one, he asked my peers and I questions that were genuinely very difficult to answer despite the answer seeming obvious when he first posed the question. I truly feel as though my conception of race and the history surrounding racism has been challenged thoroughly by this class, and I can confidently say that I think differently about these topics having taken this class. Each class I felt genuinely stumped by some of the questions we were asked to discuss, and it was exciting how discussions didn\'t just feel like synthesizing information from readings, but as though we were really trying to arrive at some sort of understanding regarding truly complex issues that wasn\'t yet obvious at the beginning of class. The way I thought about each reading transformed dramatically by the end of our discussions, which made them feel truly worthwhile. In fact, I can confidently say that this course was one of the most academically fulfilling parts of my semester. If you\'re looking for a class that will truly challenge you and force you to rethink much of how you conceive of concepts like race, this is the class for you. Furthermore, I\'d really like to emphasize what a wonderful teacher Professor Fuente is. Each week, we were assigned a brief essay that reflected on the week\'s readings, and while this assignment wasn\'t supposed to be anything more than a summary of our thoughts going into the week\'s discussion, Professor Fuente took the time to leave thoughtful feedback on every single essay we submitted. Whether it was applauding the thinking I had done or pushing me to wrestle with the readings more, I always felt that Professor Fuente truly cared about what I had to say. I felt the same in class, as he truly gave each student the space to speak, even if we were simply posing more questions to the group. He remembered details we shared about ourself on the first day of class and brought them up when relevant throughout the semester, he took interest in our lives outside of school, and, all in all, he made it clear that he cared about our wellbeing which was very comforting being new on campus. As I\'ve already said, he also genuinely challenged us every week, and it made you want to really pay attention to everything he said each discussion. Professor Fuente is also just a really interesting person with some pretty incredible life experiences he shared with us. The two hour seminar period somehow always felt too short!One thing I will say is that if you are simply looking for the easiest freshman seminar option, this class is probably not for you. Readings in this class were long, with full books being assigned for the week\'s homework sometimes. In addition to that, there was a short essay due reflecting on those readings each week. However, none of those readings ever felt useless. Each class discussion made it very clear WHY we had read a given text or series of texts, and I believe that attempting to cut some of those out would have sacrificed valuable material from the course. Furthermore, the course is structured chronologically, so you really understand the connection between the various texts throughout the semester. Lastly, I cannot express enough what a wonderful experience this class is, and I think that ought to make the greater\u2013than\u2013average freshman seminar workload worth it. It truly is just a great course with a great professor teaching it, and what you take away from Race Science is so worth a couple of reading cram sessions throughout the semester, especially if the rest of your schedule isn\'t too rough. Please don\'t avoid this course because of workload if you think you\'ll be interested in the content. I literally have nothing but good things to say about it. TLDR: Race Science was one of the best parts of my freshman fall, and I am so grateful to have gotten the chance to be Professor Fuente\'s student. If you are interested at all by the subject matter take the class. It\'s a great opportunity to have challenging, in\u2013depth discussions in a small\u2013group setting with other students who are similarly passionate about the course content (I loved my classmates in this course!!!!). I\'d absolutely recommend giving this course a try, and I\'m so happy to have taken it.","best_comment_short":"It\'s a great opportunity to have challenging, in\u2013depth discussions in a small\u2013group setting with other students who are similarly passionate about the course content (I loved my classmates in this course!!!!).","best_comment_first":"This class is incredible and was one of the highlights of my freshman fall!","course_id":"222107","link":"https://harvard.bluera.com/harvard/rpvf-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=14f070c779c180dfe6d8e223dd868280fa3e4d6e3450117a61b354a8402739c84700fb22897300e689eb2be989a5044d&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"},{"course_code":"MATH 60R","useful_title":"Reading Course for Senior Honors Candidates","course_score_mean":4.75,"rec_score_mean":5,"gem_probability_mean":0,"sentiment_score_median":0,"best_gem_comment":"","workload_score_mean":6.67,"best_gem_comment_short":"","best_comment":"","best_comment_short":"","best_comment_first":"","course_id":"216307","link":"https://harvard.bluera.com/harvard/rpvf-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=2c8ff89c072c35a164faa0097b1a76d289efab63c1b2caa88ede90e05019c6b0733b8fe77af29cea19a514ae748b5df0&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"},{"course_code":"CHNSE BX","useful_title":"Elementary Chinese for Advanced Beginners","course_score_mean":4.75,"rec_score_mean":4.5,"gem_probability_mean":0,"sentiment_score_median":0.9178,"best_gem_comment":"","workload_score_mean":6.31,"best_gem_comment_short":"","best_comment":"This class is difficult, but completely manageable!

He gives a very comprehensive history of Greece and its very intentional about going against the grain when it comes to accounting for things like foreign influences, which was refreshing. He also makes it all the way through lecture the vast majority of the time, so you never feel like you\'re missing out. He is very willing to pause lecture and provide further explanations for things or go down rabbit holes if you have a question. Very good with audience participation and is good at soliciting many different voices every lecture. Eli is a very good TF. His feedback on assignments always makes sense and he is very willing to meet with you during office hours to explain anything you don\'t understand. I once had to miss a lecture and Eli gave me my own personalized lecture during office hours, which made me feel like I missed basically nothing. He also offered to lend me his copy of our textbook more than once. He seems genuinely interested in making sure everyone succeeds in the class. He\'s great at leading section. My one criticism would be that he is longwinded, so if you\'re in office hours with somewhere to be, try not to ask too many questions.WORKLOAD (5/10): Readings are assigned per lecture instead of per week, which really annoyed me. My whole Sunday and Tuesday were taken up just doing the readings for this class. Most of the readings aren\'t mentioned in lecture or section, and frankly can be skimmed or skipped if you have other work to do. When readings are mentioned in lecture, Dr. Kosmin summarizes whatever is most important about them anyway (either their thesis or how they changed classical scholarship). The textbook we had this semester is very comprehensive, but everything discussed in the textbook will be reiterated in a more comprehensive, synthesized, engaging, and sensical manner in lecture. We are also only ever quizzed/tested on information from lectures, not the readings, which make them feel especially extraneous. There are weekly quizzes on information from lecture, but every lecture is accompanied by a silly little handout from Eli that literally tells you every thing you need to learn from that lecture that you\'ll be quizzed on, so you just need to pay enough attention in lecture to note what\'s important about each item. Literally the most painless weekly quizzes I\'ve ever had. We also have weekly discussion posts that are graded on completion, and Eli makes really fun prompts that always get you thinking harder about the history or scholarship. MIDTERM & FINAL (9/10): Since there are weekly quizzes, you know exactly what to expect on the midterm and final. There\'s also a final project/paper, and the project option is really cool. You get to do stuff with items from the Harvard Art Museums.","best_comment_short":"(Personal context: I\'m a History & Classics joint, who has done well in the class so far)OVERALL: 7.5/10TEACHING STAFF (8.5/10): Dr. Kosmin\'s lectures are very engaging and super fun.","best_comment_first":"(Personal context: I\'m a History & Classics joint, who has done well in the class so far)OVERALL: 7.5/10TEACHING STAFF (8.5/10): Dr. Kosmin\'s lectures are very engaging and super fun.","course_id":"116729","link":"https://harvard.bluera.com/harvard/rpvf-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=701618d9d946bcf1185568cd6d28bf75f79e2283cec7a39e92b52fcafcf17205d4447b62d57fd61eeebae8d82a36aa97&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"},{"course_code":"EXPOS 20","useful_title":"Expository Writing 20 231","course_score_mean":4.67,"rec_score_mean":4.71,"gem_probability_mean":0,"sentiment_score_median":0.9051,"best_gem_comment":"","workload_score_mean":7.38,"best_gem_comment_short":"","best_comment":"I LOVE THIS EXPOS CLASS!!!!

Chris is very responsive to questions and feedback, so don\'t be scared to ask questions!Chris is a bit more forgiving in terms of class intensity and (overall) grading than what I\'ve heard about Wes (who had taught 25a prior to this year), but you should still expect to spend a lot of time doing math: psets (one per week, due Wednesday at noon) will likely take at least 10 hours and up to 20. Note that psets will be graded more harshly (but midterm (one) and final grading is bit more charitable). Some further notes if you\'re in\u2013between 22a, 25a, and 55a:22a provides a mainly computational approach to linear algebra, whereas 25a is much more rigorous and is proof\u2013based. I would say that 25a is more of an extension of 22a, where 25a explores much more of the \\"why\\" to 22a (you will still need to know how to do computation, however, but is a smaller component of 25a). Meanwhile, 55a is a lot more fast\u2013paced and goes in a bit less depth into linear algebra; you\'ll spend around two months on linear algebra, and then spend the rest of the time on multilinear algebra (& inner/outer algebras), category theory, and representation theory. I think generally 55a tends to be a little bit more collaborative in nature, but finding peers to work with during OH for 25a is pretty easy; also I think 25a psets are doable by yourself (might take a bit longer though), whereas 55a psets are not so much.","best_comment_short":"This class can be quite aptly described as \\"locally painful,\\" but \\"globally rewarding\\" (Chris).Math 25a is a great class for anyone potentially interested in pure math, and provides a more theoretical approach to linear algebra.","best_comment_first":"This class can be quite aptly described as \\"locally painful,\\" but \\"globally rewarding\\" (Chris).Math 25a is a great class for anyone potentially interested in pure math, and provides a more theoretical approach to linear algebra.","course_id":"110808","link":"https://harvard.bluera.com/harvard/rpvf-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=89100c081e5d406e5ff76682354c3c05534d125465c051574a08847e03e2b17e8c7450e48ec868684da85f29a0017c6a&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"},{"course_code":"COMPSCI 73","useful_title":"Code, Data, and Art","course_score_mean":4.65,"rec_score_mean":4.82,"gem_probability_mean":0,"sentiment_score_median":0.9655,"best_gem_comment":"","workload_score_mean":8.55,"best_gem_comment_short":"","best_comment":"I loved this class!!!

I have lots to say, but if you don\'t read all of it, here\'s my most important point \u2014 more than teaching me math and preparing me for future studies (which it did very, very well), this course made me a smarter person. I can\'t fully describe it, and indeed it\'s somewhat uncanny \u2014 but after a semester of working through Math 55 problem sets, I genuinely notice that my mind is much sharper; I think more intelligently about the world (and I honestly didn\'t think that was possible) far outside of math. What more could I every ask from a course?Math 55 has a reputation. But no, it doesn\'t take over your life; you can still take other tough classes, be part of some clubs, and have time for your friends (believe me, I did it, and many others alongside me). Don\'t be fazed by the \\"hours per week\\" \u2014 it\'s much more manageable than you think. And yes, it\'s hard. But that\'s the best part. It\'s more than a class. You make so many close friends and find a wonderful community with your classmates, CAs, and the math department as a whole. Think of it this way: The College claims the First\u2013Year Seminar Program is designed to help you integrate into the Harvard academic community \u2014 and that\'s true, but Math 55 is even better.The hardest part of the course isn\'t the content. It\'s the speed and the homework. But Joe Harris is amazing (and I\'m sure whoever they assign to teach it in the future will be, too). I truly didn\'t notice the speed we were moving at \u2014 it always feels like he is moving slowly (in a good way), but he manages to cover so much content in a way that every person in the room understands. I have nothing but praise for him. Oh, and his lecture notes are the best. Side note \u2014 follow Joe Harris wherever he goes in his post\u201355 future. You won\'t regret it.Now for the best part\xa0\u2014 the homework. Math 55 problem sets are, well, a rite of passage. Yes, they\'re harder \u2014 in fact, I\'ll admit that they\'re harder than they need to be for you to learn the content. But solving the problems (whether on your own, or, more often than not, with your soon\u2013to\u2013be best friends) and writing up your proofs engages you with the content in a new way unlike any other assignment in any other course. Believe me, the course is the way it is for a reason \u2014 for you to learn, have fun, and make friends. If you like math, take advantage of it while you\'re here. There is quite literally no better exercise for your brain.You have to live it to know it, but Math 55 is a truly transformational experience unlike any other. In hindsight, I would pick Harvard over any other school just to take this course. There is no better way to start your Harvard journey. And you\'ll have so, so much fun along the way \u2014 from way too many inside jokes to memorable late nights in the math lounge.

Professor Blitzstein\u2019s lecturing ability was undoubtedly a selling point for the course \u2013 even as someone who has done measure theory before I appreciated his exposition of most of the mathematical side of the material. Problem sets were interesting, appropriately challenging and fun to do with other students. Regarding the actual material itself, I will split my review into two halves:1. \'The good stuff\'. (Probability and Measure, Representations of Distributions, Expectation and Conditional Expectation, Generating functions, Martingales). I really loved these parts of the course. Learning about these topics answered a lot of unanswered questions I had from 110 in the summer, and simultaneously led me to have very many followup questions (both mathematical and practical) about the material that Prof. Blitzstein and the TFs were great at answering. There are loads of powerful tools here that are really lovelily motivated in lecture and that can be used to approach problems in applied probability much more elegantly than than the approaches one would use in 110. I\'m sure this would be mentioned by others as well but I would really like to sing praises especially for Representations and Martingales for helping me build additional dimensions both in my problem solving toolkit and in my appreciation for the beauty of the subject. This might be controversial (especially amongst the maths concentrators), but I personally thought the Measure Theory was done in 210 to an appropriate amount \u2013 enough that one understands its role as a \\"construction tool\\" for many otherwise not\u2013obviously\u2013well\u2013defined objects that we are working with, but not so much that it got tedious or boring (and believe me when I say that I do not want to read through Royden and Fitzpatrick ever again). The one caveat that I might make is to just briefly expand the conditional expectation topic to a more general one on the construction of conditional probability \u2013 didn\'t understand since 110 why conditioning on an event of zero probability made sense and I feel as though myself and many others would have found the idea of how one might do that enlightening. 2. \'The slump\' (Multivariate Normal and Asymptotics). Enough said. These parts of the course were terrible and were possibly the worst parts of any course I have taken at Harvard (to be fair I don\'t think I\'ve had experience with truly terrible classes here). I feel like whilst thinking about how to teach these topics, Prof. Blitzstein didn\'t feel the need to motivate these as he feels as though we will see plenty of applications in Stat 111, 212, 230 etc. . I completely understand this viewpoint, and especially as a PhD statistics student I could see why learning about these topics would be enlightening, but for me (and a lot of other undergrads who typically take this class) whose exposure to Stat is limited to Stat 110 and 210, I didn\'t really get to see why these ideas were important at all. This would have been fine if the material was beautiful, but it wasn\'t \u2013 it was ugly, full of bash and uninteresting. Most importantly I did not feel as though these topics were in line with the theme of the class of looking at 110 material from a more elegant and interesting perspective. It really is a shame that I hated these parts of the class so much as I feel as though Prof. Blitzstein could have made these topics a lot more fun and interesting by recognising that these parts of the course are not the most intrinsically beautiful and adapting by motivating this section of the course a lot more via cool applied scenarios like he does for everything else in 110 and 210 (to be fair, I\'m possibly beating on a dead horse here because I feel as though I am in the majority of Harvard maths students in the sense that I hated Real Analysis I for its ugliness was so it is probably safe to say I still wouldn\'t have loved \'the slump\' anywhere near as much as \'the good stuff\' but it would have definitely helped it go from terrible to at least meh to see it motivated better).Nevertheless, I\'m really glad I took this course and I feel like I enjoyed it overall. I am sure that it is miles more interesting than what Graduate Probability Theory would look like at most other universities.

The first half of the course went rather fine; it sometimes took a while to  fully understand concepts but leading up to the midterm, everything was pretty ok. Second half of the course also went OK \u2014 until the last 2/3 weeks\u2013ish.

I feel like I only really understood Seifert\u2013van Kampen after the final, which, needless to say, is too late. In any case, if you\'re fluent in set theory, knowledgable in rigorous calculus, and conversational in group theory, then take this course. Honestly, I wish I took 122 concurrently with this course.

He gives positive feedback on your answer even if it\'s not quite right, and encourages participation for things like examples of English words that have some characteristic, which may feel easier to answer than a question about linguistic theory.I didn\'t really make friends in this class, but I recommend you do for checking psets over.

I think if you like linguistics as much as I do, which I am guessing you do if you are a concentrator or taking a secondary in it, this class is the bee\'s knees. Professor Bobaljik is a really good professor. I recommend taking advantage of office hours to get the most out of the class.

TAKE THIS CLASS!! I cannot recommend it highly enough. If you are interested in theory, if you interested in machine learning at all, then this is the class for you. In my honest opinion, this class explores one of the most exciting research fields in math, computer science, and statistics. There is an abundance of empirical phenomena in machine learning/deep learning that are not well\u2013understood, and the nascent theory to try to explain them is flourishing (most of the papers Prof. Chen discusses are less than 10 years old.)   If you are curious about this extremely new area of theory, then this class gives you the right mental framework, the mathematical tools, the background to think about these problems.  In that regard, this class was a formative experience for me and inspired me to go to graduate school.  Prerequisites: In terms of concrete requirements you should know theoretical linear algebra (Axler suffices) and real analysis. The research field does not use sophisticated techniques beyond this, and Prof. Chen introduces the background knowledge when necessary. The main requirement is strong problem solving skills.  Lectures: The lectures are very fast, as Prof. Chen basically goes through a paper or two every lecture. It is not easy to follow the lectures, but I thought they were extremely fun, challenging, and engaging. Prof. Chen also does a great job at emphasizing the important ideas of a paper and appropriately splits time between derivations and big concepts. Moreover, Prof. Chen does an amazing job connecting the ideas in the class together and forming cohesive themes throughout the semester. You get the sense that this course is building to some larger goals.Problem sets: I really enjoyed working on the problem sets.

Staying two nights at the forest once a month was such a cool and unique experience, and I bonded so much with everyone else in the class. There is a lot being thrown at you on the class days, but is balanced out nicely by how much fun you are having. Dave is an excellent teacher and truly like a father figure to everyone in the class. He makes the experience so special. You also get to have only 3 classes the rest of the month,  since this class doesn\'t meet regularly, which takes a HUGE load off academically and is a nice way to get adjusted. The homework is minimal. There is reading to do before each weekend. The only submitted work (aside from the final paper) is to submit a short writeup answering a couple questions, due 1 week after each trip. These are very low\u2013stakes, chill assignments that don\'t take long, and you don\'t have any submitted homework at all the rest of the month. The final paper was legit but manageable and we had a lot of time to work on it. The forest was absolutely beautiful, the stars were incredible, and it was so cool to get to go around and explore nature \u2013 great way to escape the Cambridge bubble and get outside. The accomodations are truly outstanding as well \u2013 you live in a huge house with tons of beds, tons of space, nice bathrooms and showers, an active kitchen, and tons and tons of free food and drink that is purchased for you to snack on. You really feel like it is your home and you have total free reign to live in the space. You also learn a lot over the course of this class! Getting off campus 1 weekend per month is really not a huge commitment and is honestly really good for you \u2013 I looked forward to those weekends more than anything. It felt like an escape from the stress of Harvard life and into a whole separate world. In conclusion \u2013 this is literally, like, the best class ever conceived.

From the very first round of speeches, I was absolutely blown away with how much I was already learning. Throughout the course, I learned how to become an evocative story teller, how to engage directly with the audience, speak on the spot, widen the range in both my vocal tone and body language, utilize the physical space on stage, work with slides and/or props, and weave numerous rhetorical devices into my speeches. At the same time,  each student was given the space to develop their own style, and everybody had at least one outstanding strength that they could share with the rest of the class (from comforting the audience, to projecting their voice, to bringing vulnerability to their speeches, to incorporating humor, and more). Kate and the class always provided helpful feedback that made each one of us a better speaker.  We would do short practice rounds after each speech to incorporate the feedback, and I would often be blown away at how much more impactful people\'s speeches would become. We also play fun warm up games to start each class (if you\'ve ever done theater/drama, they\'re similar to those). They might seem silly at first, but they are in fact really helpful, particularly the improv exercises that prepare you for impromptu speaking. Last note on speaking: I really appreciated the space we were given to experiment with each speech. I never felt like I was ever going to be penalized if something fell flat, and making mistakes and figuring out feels most natural were pivotal in my development as an independent speaker and thinker. I was truly taking the class to LEARN, and I loved every moment of it.The class not only taught me about public speaking, but it also reminded me why I wanted to come to Harvard in the first place. Because Expos 40 is an elective, people from all concentrations take the class. I only knew a couple of other classmates coming into the class, and I am so glad to have met such an interesting and kind group of people. I loved listening to everyone\'s speeches \u2013 their various perspectives, passions, hopes, fears, and goals. I learned as much from my peers as I did from the structural parts of the course, and I don\'t think I could have had that with any other class. Come in with an open mind and intention to be an engaged peer, and you will get so much from this course.1000% recommend! Lottery, and lottery again if you need to! If I could, I would take this class again in a heartbeat!","best_comment_short":"At the same time,  each student was given the space to develop their own style, and everybody had at least one outstanding strength that they could share with the rest of the class (from comforting the audience, to projecting their voice, to bringing vulnerability to their speeches, to incorporating humor, and more).","best_comment_first":"This is hands\u2013down the best class I\'ve taken at Harvard.","course_id":"125227","link":"https://harvard.bluera.com/harvard/rpvf-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=8ee12366722c58d06b63b5c962309462198a39691edc2cba3925ac290ceb5b5423dfb0f14ac0c9a1135f2f7146255c32&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"},{"course_code":"GHHP 50","useful_title":"The Quality of Health Care in America","course_score_mean":4.97,"rec_score_mean":4.97,"gem_probability_mean":0,"sentiment_score_median":0.9393,"best_gem_comment":"","workload_score_mean":2.47,"best_gem_comment_short":"","best_comment":"BEST class at Harvard, no competition.

Also, who else can say they\'ve held a human heart in their hands!4. Also, Dr. Millham cares greatly about his students. Especially during some of the rougher weeks of the semester, he is an awesome source of kindness and food to his students when he was not required to be. Definitely one of the most conscientious teachers I\'ve ever had.","best_comment_short":"Dr. Millham has established such a good relationship with all the professionals at these locations, and I could really tell they love what they do.","best_comment_first":"1.","course_id":"127976","link":"https://harvard.bluera.com/harvard/rpvf-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=4fbd4fafdd5d1c17c83780a4efe3c78698c22139e64879d51e14c1b2b250b2d28bc54b75d2e377b88672c8f212cd92e7&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"},{"course_code":"CHEM 177","useful_title":"The Chemistry, Biology, and Societal Implications of Genome Editing","course_score_mean":4.65,"rec_score_mean":4.76,"gem_probability_mean":0,"sentiment_score_median":0.6059,"best_gem_comment":"","workload_score_mean":2.94,"best_gem_comment_short":"","best_comment":"Overall, a great class. David is SERIOUSLY talented as a scientist, mentor, and lecturer \u2013\u2013 I have no idea how he hasn\'t won a Nobel prize yet. He\'s extremely knowledgable about all things gene editing, but also an entertaining lecturer. The class dives into a *lot* of different aspects of gene editing \u2013\u2013 mechanisms, pharmaceutical development, policy, ethics, etc. I honestly didn\'t think it would be able to cover everything, but we went in depth on basically everything they mentioned in the syllabus! It\'s totally focused on the science elements though, so I\'d recommend a different class (SCRB 120?) if you\'re interested in the ethical debates of gene editing. It\'s tough to make a 3 hour class on Friday  evening entertaining, but David does a pretty good job. If you\'re not used to long classes, though, the lecture can be really brutal. As engaging as David is as a lecturer, the class isn\'t very interactive (it\'s 2 hours of content\u2013based lecture, and 45 minutes of student presentations on individual papers related to that week\'s topic). The final projects were really fun, and we had a lot of creative liberty. The TFs are also a shining part of this course experience. Nick and Colin are AMAZING. Absolutely phenomenal!!!

It\'s a true survey class, so the expectations are not too high while the support is generous from the professor. You will learn so so much, and I really enjoyed the work I produced in the class.

Never before have I seen a course staff (Especially Heidi) who care so much about students. This semester we worked on molecular glue synthesis. I learned organic lab techniques (Biotage, HPLC, inert atmosphere, etc), but my bigger takeaways were with how synthesis research is done. We gave group meeting presentations, annotated spectra, and wrote supporting information for our compounds (like for a paper). The poster presentation at the end seemed daunting but each step was broken down and honestly was not too stressful because of the support the staff gave. You also have a Lab Partner to split most assignments with!!The science advocacy component of this class was cool and definitely do the DC trip if you sign up! Talking to staffers and congressmen/senators was a cool experience.I loved the community the class produces. The 10 students this semester really forged strong friendships in this class and this was a powerful experience.Advice: do as much of the work/assignments in class so you can ask any questions if you are unsure or get stuck. You can leave the lab early and go home, but I usually stayed till the end to finish the assignments and basically not have research work outside of class. Workload is very fair for this class.Side Note: Chem 135 (experimental synthetic organic chemistry) is taught alongside Chem 100r. Chem 135 is a smaller and faster\u2013paced course with more advanced labs, but does not have the science advocacy component (this may change) and also at least in this iteration of the course was less project\u2013based.

Without that, you will probably struggle in 55b.That said, whether or not you took 55a \u2014 55b is easier. It is less work, and, in my opinion, the content is more fun.

The course probably improves your writing just like any other Expos class would, but I think what\'s especially nice about this class compared to other Expos classes (at least according to what I heard from my friends also taking Expos) is that Dr. Gold is really good at giving constructive feedback and advice that\'s very fitting to your questions. In that vein, she\'s also very accessible in terms of draft conferences and office hours. Her feedback allowed me to get past the early obstacles in my essay writing, which makes the essay writing process a lot easier overall \u2013 you can spend more time developing your arguments and mapping out your structure, rather than getting stuck on, say, formulating your thesis. Also, Dr. Gold is super lenient with deadlines \u2013 if something is due on Monday at 12am, it\'s actually due before she wakes up on Tuesday morning, so if you\'re a night owl, this is really helpful! That being said, I think you could also say that writing essays in this class is a little \\"easier\\" than in some other classes if you\'re interested in the topic. Theses are pretty easy to formulate since you\'re probably well\u2013acquainted with a selection of feminism\u2013related sources and pop culture, so essays can grow from your natural line of reasoning, whereas in more \\"obscure\\" Expos topics, it might be harder to do that, meaning you might spend more time on your essays.

He was confident about the material he taught, and he had answers to every question we asked. He engaged us and encouraged debate about the topics we discussed, fostering some of the most intellectually rigorous conversations we have had in our college careers thus far; with his guidance and pointers, we not only better understood the points we were making, but we also understood opposing perspectives too. He also took the time to meet with so many of us individually to ensure that we not only understood all the theories we discussed, but also that we understood the econometric process necessary to undertake different research projects. He spent hours beyond the scope of Office Hours and Class to meet and make sure we all understood the material being taught, even though he has another job at the Fed and has a family to care for.

The class was certainly a challenge \u2014 I had to block of quite a bit of time over the weekend to do the weekly readings and at times it felt like I was reading at a snails pace \u2014 but overall it was extremely doable. The teaching staff provides so much support to make it possible. There are vocab lists every week with key vocabulary that helps a lot for the readings. Because the texts are a bit challenging your Chinese improves quite noticeably over the course of the class which is great. You also have a one on one meeting with the TFs every week to answer questions, discuss the texts, and get feedback on your paper. The paper is super scaffolded because you only have to turn in a short chunk of it every other week. I will flag that you have to come up with your paper topic extremely early in the semesters, though, so I would start thinking about that right away. The one caveat I will say for this class is that there are *a lot* of assignments and deadlines. But the grading is extremely generous and there\'s extra credit, so while you have a fair bit to do every week grades are not a concern.Ultimately, it was extremely rewarding to feel that years of studying Chinese has paid off to the point where instead of learning to read in Chinese I am now reading to learn.

Remember to factor in transportation time to your laboratory which can increase the time commitment to 18\u201320 hours/week depending on how frequently you go into lab. My advice is to either (A) make sure the rest of your course load is light or (B) work out an arrangement with your PI where the time commitment is more flexible/potentially involves remote work to make it more manageable. Now, for the grading of the course. I would absolutely recommend having a conversation with potential PI\'s you are looking to work with about their expectations for what you need to do to get an A. Also, check in weekly with them about whether or not you are on track (if not, what you can do to get on track). As long as you do this, you should be able to get an A. One last thing, do not overcommit yourself or make promises you cannot keep in order to get an A because that will only backfire. Read here for the assignments. The amazing thing about this course is that outside of what your PI assigns you in lab, there is only one assignment!

It begins with some basic concepts from stat 210 with some more rigor (e.g., review of conditional expectation and convergence theorems); then, one discusses the Martingale Convergence theorem, uniform integrability, and convergence in L^p spaces. The classic 0\u20131 laws are discussed, with applications, e.g. in LLN or U\u2013statistics; exchangeability is introduced. Some concentration inequalities (azuma, efron\u2013stein) are proven. The first half of the course then ends with the martingale CLT, which is quite a cool result! The second half then begins with a discussion of Brownian Motion (intro, construction, uniqueness, properties), etc. One then moves to Stein\'s method. Finally, there is a final project, in which one reads a paper (typically somewhat recent research output), and gives a presentation. Overall, the material is quite fun, and there are a lot of cool theorems and proof methods!~ comments ~The course is organized in a very good manner, as to provide both fundamentals and a bit of an idea of the field. Most courses tend to do only one of the two (or neither). However, the basic material (first half and BM) are done fairly rigorously; occasionally measure theory is swept under the rug, but it can be justified with some (and not too great) effort. The book recommendations are very good: Durrett (PTE) is satisfactory for most of the rigor in measure theory (I spent a good amount of time reading details outside of course\u2013time; it also covers some useful concepts not done in 212), Morters\u2013Peres (Brownian Motion) is a good intro to BM and the later chapters (I read a few extras for fun) cover some surprising and cool facts, for instance geometric properties of BM and its relation to random walks); lastly \'Fundamentals on Stein\'s Method\' (cf. arxiv) provides rigor for the Stein\'s method parts. I find that the very important fundamentals are done quite rigorously and well; some results are introduced to give a sense of what types of results have been proven, and this latter type is usually not justified, but rather intuition (which is good) is provided. The lecturing is fantastic. The usual way I like lectures to go is to either (1) explicate the material in a clear and engaging manner or (2) provide some intuition otherwise not found. These are both done; the first half of the course especially, Morgane encourages participation and engagement by asking questions about how to proceed; following closely in the course was helpful both in understanding the proofs better and being able to come up with and understand the main techniques of proof (e.g., \'definitions!\'). Lecturing speed varies; I found that it started quite quickly and then in the end slowed down a bit. As noted in the last paragraph, I think intuition for the unproven results provided was very useful, whereas the basic facts were justified rigorously (and for these, the intuition often comes from going through the basic ideas and really thinking about the math over and over again). The assignments are fairly chill and fun. There are about 5 HW assignments, with one drop; there are a large number of additional problems and HWs which are very useful when studying the exam or for gaining more familiarity with the concepts (so one has enough problems to work with, but there is minimal stress). The final project was a fun way to see what sort of methods and ideas are being researched in probability (e.g., random matrix theory, Stein\'s method, etc.). Admittedly, it was pretty difficult to comprehend the presentations, but I enjoyed it because one gains a viewpoint of how the course can lead to later research. Now, a few miscellaneous comments \u2014 the exams are not easy, but contain many fun problems. Studying is certainly necessary but the review process is helpful in going through the main ideas of the course, and there are a number of problems and past finals which are enjoyable (there are a lot of \'cute\' problems). I would advise one to read the reference materials, both for review purposes, and because they are good classics, which provide a lot of extras (concepts or \'measure theory\' etc!) Lastly, Morgane is very approachable outside of class; I went to a few office hours to ask questions, in addition to our final project meeting. She provides helpful wisdom, both in respect to the main concepts of the course as well as life advice, e.g. experiences in grad school, which I appreciate. I came into this semester with a heavy math background and stat 210 deciding that I wanted a change from heavily abstract mathematics to learn more stats \u2014 this course has genuinely built my enjoyment and interest in probability and was important in helping me settle my focus in the field; in this way it has been a very important course for my personal path. It also has provided a satisfyingly large collection of resources for further exploration (e.g., there are the three course references mentioned; a collection of papers from final projects, resources for random matrix theory, etc.).

Narrowing down at least a topic of study before the semester will allow you to use class to your full benefit and will, in general, make your experience more chill. Second, be aware that the course is quite chill at the beginning of the semester (think 1\u20133 hrs per week) and that towards the end of the semester, once you start drafting, the work spikes a lot (think 8ish hours per week once you start drafting, with potentially many more during reading period. I think I was spending 4\u20135 hrs per day on the essay for the week before it was due). This is kind of unavoidable, but the more seriously you take the drafting assignments the better the last few weeks of the class will be.

Looking back on the entire year, taking this class was one of my best decisions (and with the lottery to even get in the class, a stroke of luck I am so grateful for).Given that you took LS 50A, I would strongly recommend continuing with LS 50B (look at that application of Bayes\' Theorem!). It\'s really satisfying seeing how the material from the spring builds upon material from the fall \u2013 all the science you learn really *integrates* together. For example, linear algebra is the *basis* for Markov chains which *feeds forward* into neural networks and then suddenly dynamical systems is back to provide a *stable* foundation for models of action potentials. There is so much interesting material in the spring \u2013 I especially enjoyed Markov chains, protein structures, and computational sequence analysis. My one note is that the linear algebra crash course is very fast so it might be helpful to prepare for that. You really won\'t find another class like this. Not to sound dramatic, but LS 50 has the power to change the way you think and approach problems, and an important part of this comes from having the experience of the entire year. Sure, in LS 50A Bayes\' Theorem might just sound like a fancy name for two way probability tables and what even is a prior, but when you actually put it into words and apply it to hypothesis testing in the context of sequence analysis, it suddenly becomes concrete and relevant. who knows, this might become some arrival\u2013esque thing where you start to think of your life in terms of ls50 material \u2013 there\'s enough of it to go around.LS 50B is a chiller course than LS 50A \u2013 easier psets and exams (and no stat mech) \u2013 and by the spring you\'ll already have had a whole semester to get accustomed with the idiosyncrasies of LS 50, so that altogether makes for a more relaxing experience. This semester is less about trauma bonding and more about bonding over being in LS 50 together and realizing that time is coming to an end.But obviously, the biggest reason to stick with the course is for the community. The LS 50 community is so special and was a significant part of my freshman year \u2013 and while it\'s not immediately apparent, the truth is that the class is really instrumental for building and maintaining friendships. Daily meetings, late night psetting, lab karaoke, and post lab Berg meals go a long way toward forging connections and core memories. Also, you get to partake in designing class merch which is so much fun. Truly, through \u2013 the course staff, the CAs, and your classmates are what make the class special. And assuming that you\'ve already taken LS 50A, you already know how kind, available, supportive, and all around amazing the LS 50 course staff is \u2013 all the more reason to stay. If you\'re still on the fence, I highly recommend speaking to them to figure out what\'s best for you.I cannot stress enough the value of staying for a second semester of LS 50. The content, the connections, the community \u2013 there\'s so much to gain from continuing on. And the spring is much less stressful than the fall, so you\'ll be alright. You\'ll do great in LS 50Bby any means necessary. \u2764\ufe0f","best_comment_short":"Looking back on the entire year, taking this class was one of my best decisions (and with the lottery to even get in the class, a stroke of luck I am so grateful for).Given that you took LS 50A, I would strongly recommend continuing with LS 50B (look at that application of Bayes\' Theorem!).","best_comment_first":"LS 50 is a truly transformative experience.","course_id":"159707","link":"https://harvard.bluera.com/harvard/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=73b02b91733ca627c9b2c92819b1407f48d82c95656a75d38d04fc612f3075a8e61f1c5a78038e0ba7c9159ccaa3ea58&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"},{"course_code":"KOREAN BB","useful_title":"Elementary Korean","course_score_mean":4.57,"rec_score_mean":4.57,"gem_probability_mean":0,"sentiment_score_median":0.9161,"best_gem_comment":"","workload_score_mean":4.86,"best_gem_comment_short":"","best_comment":"Take this class!

That means that you talk a lot about biotech and genetics, but in ways that I wasn\'t talking about those topics in my other bio/chem courses. The grading was super fair and I actually always enjoyed researching and writing my essays because the topic was so interesting. The final paper itself is also really open to interpretation, you can research anything you want that is in some way related to biotech, genetics, or mortality. I really loved our class discussions, the majority of section time is this so it\'s very low stress but interesting. Dr. Raymer is also the best!! She gives great feedback and is always willing to stick around after class or schedule a time to talk about any issues you\'re having with your papers. She\'s so sweet and was the most accommodating out of any of my professors with sick days. She genuinely really cares about her students and wants to help. There were some weeks with maybe like an hour or two of readings, but they were interesting and you don\'t have to read them all everytime.

As far as gov classes are concerned, this has been one of my favorites so far! Professor Hummel has done a beautiful job of breaking each week down into manageable chunks, with a good mix of interesting readings that connect well with what is discussed in lecture.  Keeping up with each of the readings is more than possible, and she uses fun reading competitions on Poll everywhere to check for understanding of those readings. The class has roughly six response memos, due every other week and 3\u20134 pages each, asking you to connect the memoirs you read to the internal or external metric that the memoirs are associated with. Additionally, it has a final paper, 12\u201315 pages, where you evaluate the success of a chosen movement based on the semester\'s worth of learning. However, there are pre\u2013submissions built into the course to give you feedback and make sure you are on the right track for the big paper at the end of the semester. for those who need any kind of accommodations, the teaching staff are incredible at making sure you have what you need, and as long as you communicate ahead of time, professor Hummel is extremely proactive in making sure that you are taken care of. Finally, the course staff is super understanding and flexible, providing a 48 hour extension bank that you can distribute as you please throughout the semester for every assignment except the final one.

Be ready to study and put in effort though, the class is really not bad in hindsight but it was often overwhelming and stressful knowing you have other exams and work on top of understanding this material.Try on EVERY exam, especially the first. Getting three attempts on a question is better than two or one as you will not always get an easier question on the next attempt or can make a small, correctable mistake that you can try on the next exam.  This happened and often found myself stressed over stars to get a good grade, but everything worked out in the end once I realized how to study for the course and learn the material. The questions are also not easy, there is no partial credit and you will need to get every component 100% correct to get the point which can often seem overwhelming. The concept of stars seemed great, then horrible, but then great once I got the rhythm of efficiently studying. The psets are also designed to challenge you, but make sure you understand them weekly as if not, you will struggle on the exams (like it said in the syllabus). I found myself only completing the psets and not really understanding them which made for applying what I learned so much more difficult. Definitely know the lecture material before attempting, it will all click once you get it. Kathryn and Gregorio are great professors and want you to succeed. Make sure to use their office hours effectively as their sessions are the most useful. They are also happy to meet 1 on 1 if you are struggling, which helped me get caught up and get back on track.The labs are heavy coding based, but not bad. Definitely know the basics python if possible, it will make them labs so much easier, but they are also not very hard and are mainly there to reinforce concepts from lecture and are mainly taking data and analyzing it with python equations.Stay on track, understand the material, put in effort on exams and you will succeed!

I think students who were already good at writing definitely thrived in this class, while as someone with a relatively untraditional background, I struggled a bit, so I cannot recommend starting EARLY and going to Dr. B with questions enough. She is very supportive and helpful, but deadlines creep up fast. Still, assignment prompts are pretty flexible and I really felt like Dr. B cared about each of us developing as a writer.

Here are the reasons why:1) Ample study material. The course is accompanied by a very clear and well\u2013written textbook that has been generated specifically for this course over Eli\'s many years of teaching APMTH 120. This is paired with a DropBox of coding examples for most of the topics you need to be able to replicate (which you should note as a useful resource for homework assignments). You will never need to scour for random resources or PDFs on the internet, as I have for so many previous classes. These materials tell you exactly what you need to know, with clear explanations or examples for each topic.2) Extremely fair quizzes and exams. You will be provided with a clear list of topics to master, as well as access to every past practice exam covering that same material. Eli doesn\'t believe in surprises on exams (though it would have been good to have a heads\u2013up about the block power method this year...). The TFs are clear and responsive when you request help or need additional clarifications. If you decide to prepare in advance, you have every ability to do well.3) Highly applicable and relevant content. It was rare that we studied a topic that seemed unrelated to direct applications in data science. This is genuinely an applied class.4) Useful and achievable assignments. All the problem sets have clear instructions, as well as ample help available via office hours and Ed. They are almost perfectly tailored for the amount of time that you have available for them and will set you up well for the exams with no unnecessary head\u2013banging.5) Great course staff and a strong support structure. The TFs under Eli are fantastic and responsive. There are a lot of windows for office hours, and they will take time out of their busy weeks to write clear responses to your stupid questions on Ed. They\'ll even do things like make supplementary materials or videos to explain trickier concepts. You\'ll never feel lost at sea.6) An awesome professor. Eli is a wonderful guy \u2014 I laughed out loud at least once per lecture \u2014\xa0and he\'s the perfect person to teach this class.Don\'t get me wrong, the course is not necessarily *flexible* \u2014 there\'s a strict lateness policy, and the homework assignments come like clockwork every week, including spring break \u2014 but it\'s consistent, realistic, and the course staff will provide all the support in the world for you. I\'m a burned out junior in AM who doesn\'t really feel like taking mind\u2013numbing and/or poorly organized upper\u2013level technical classes anymore, slogging through random proofs, learning about abstract concepts I don\'t care about, or spending hours debugging in whatever awful programming language my professor happens to like. Most classes I\'ve taken at Harvard involve at least one of these attributes, typically several, but this class had none of that. It was clear, helpful, and the right degree of challenging, and I feel like the value I got out of the course scaled linearly with every hour of work I put in. I learned a lot of content in spite of myself. I\'m really glad I took AM 120 and hope you take it too.","best_comment_short":"They are almost perfectly tailored for the amount of time that you have available for them and will set you up well for the exams with no unnecessary head\u2013banging.5) Great course staff and a strong support structure.","best_comment_first":"This is literally the best STEM class I have taken in my time at Harvard as a junior in applied mathematics.","course_id":"113876","link":"https://harvard.bluera.com/harvard/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=69cb0449bf5d2de2836a92f7cee23ddb4550ec094309943dd998b1f2355df5a94a5ea38c56d076b6b42450fab756894a&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"},{"course_code":"MATH 157","useful_title":"Mathematics in the World","course_score_mean":4.27,"rec_score_mean":4.19,"gem_probability_mean":0,"sentiment_score_median":0.9294,"best_gem_comment":"","workload_score_mean":7.94,"best_gem_comment_short":"","best_comment":"Take this class with friends and you\'ll have the best time.

I personally am a joint CS and Math concentrator (but am doing an English secondary), so I feel that I can \u201csee both sides of the veil,\u201d if that makes sense. I have a few diffuse thoughts. First, the reading list in this class is absolutely excellent. You read a good dose of the \u201cclassics\u201d (like Woolf, Orwell, and Montaigne), a good dose of \u201cmodern picks\u201d (like Jia Tolentino, Zadie Smith, and some of Prof Wood\u2019s friends that happen to be able to visit class), as well as one book that has rocketed into my all\u2013time favorites (The Periodic Table by Primo Levi). Second, Prof Wood is really quite an amazing lecturer. He has built a career doing \u201cliterary deconstructionism,\u201d and so it\u2019s a treat listening to him break open a piece. I do think the lectures near the end of term fall off, however; he has less to say about some of the packets of modern essays. Finally, a word on this class\u2019s difficulty. It really isn\u2019t a huge time sink, and you can skate by if you want to without doing much reading. However, the beauty of English 185 is that the readings are actually manageable\u2014so you will get so much more intellectual richness out of this class IF YOU READ! Also, the workload outside of reading is fairly light; it\u2019s just 2 essays. However, these are supposed to be good pieces (by the standards of an English concentrator, not by the standards of your gen\u2013ed TF)\u2014and that is a nontrivial task.","best_comment_short":"You read a good dose of the \u201cclassics\u201d (like Woolf, Orwell, and Montaigne), a good dose of \u201cmodern picks\u201d (like Jia Tolentino, Zadie Smith, and some of Prof Wood\u2019s friends that happen to be able to visit class), as well as one book that has rocketed into my all\u2013time favorites (The Periodic Table by Primo Levi).","best_comment_first":"English 185 is a fantastic course for concentrator and non\u2013concentrator alike.","course_id":"207555","link":"https://harvard.bluera.com/harvard/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=b891a83c2453782c3fc279163567cb5b58e54b5ebecc4456005d8e547968bada923a70bb0daa1cea3a23f4830e575439&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"},{"course_code":"EXPOS 40","useful_title":"Public Speaking Practicum","course_score_mean":5,"rec_score_mean":5,"gem_probability_mean":0,"sentiment_score_median":0.93195,"best_gem_comment":"","workload_score_mean":3.5,"best_gem_comment_short":"","best_comment":"TAKE THIS CLASS!

We learned about mindfulness from its origins to it\'s scientific operational definition, to how it can be applied to the self, and to sports. I found this interesting content, but also super manageable because there was very little homework and even with only skimming the readings I found that I could learn from them and understand them thanks to class discussions where everyone could build off of each other. Sheza is sooo nice and clearly cares about the subject, and is what some may call a tough grader, but really helps us develop our writing through helpful feedback. This class was also cool b/c it only had 2 graded papers and ends with a creative capstone group project. We also got to do fun things like yoga, and visiting different locations that also helped me better understand mindfulness. I actually enjoy meditating now.","best_comment_short":"I found this interesting content, but also super manageable because there was very little homework and even with only skimming the readings I found that I could learn from them and understand them thanks to class discussions where everyone could build off of each other.","best_comment_first":"This class was a good take.","course_id":"116353","link":"https://harvard.bluera.com/harvard/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=8479c376c46a3cc30a42e1f4aaedc504f1c1ec1568520f12ad20291d896290499622e3ee9f827722964f77ba983e9898&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"},{"course_code":"PSY 18","useful_title":"Psychopathology","course_score_mean":4.62,"rec_score_mean":4.65,"gem_probability_mean":0,"sentiment_score_median":0.8622,"best_gem_comment":"","workload_score_mean":3.8,"best_gem_comment_short":"","best_comment":"This class is amazing.

The textbook in my opinion is not completely necessary but can be helpful to learn excerpts that you do not fully understand. Read the memoir books, they are really great books and easy reads, the 2 4 page essays are guided and really easy, and not graded too difficulty.

What forms of medicine are okay? Should treatment be mediated by a Brain\u2013Computer interface? The class also has such a great energy. It\'s interactive but not in an awkward way and Dr. Silbersweig does a great job at encouraging discussion. The weekly assignments are just summaries of the two of the readings in a meaninful way, and a greater question that the readings made us think about; they were pretty easy, except some weeks the readings were long.
